        "overview": "This course for serious makers, and for students new to imagemaking. Imagemaking is a fluid and exciting area of graphic design that comes out of practice and process: experimenting fearlessly, showing and sharing ideas, and giving and receiving knowledgeable and constructive input.\n\nFor the sake of this online platform, we have applied some structure to our investigations, but for the most part imagemaking is loose and unstructured. If we must adopt a rule in this course it is only this: you will not become a graphic designer by watching videos alone. Or, don't just make stuff just in your head. So here, the focus here is on making, and you are expected to devote serious time and intellectual energy to that activity in this course. Specifically, you will:\n\n- experiment with a range of materials and techniques to make images for graphic design\n- expand your visual vocabulary both in terms of making and talking about work, in order to discuss your work and work of others\n- learn how to make, manipulate and arrange images to create compositions, eventually culminating in the design and production of an-image-based book.\n\nThe first half of the course is an opportunity to experiment and explore imagemaking in order to expand your visual vocabulary. You will create pieces that are expressive, meditative, or 'design-y' to instigate, evoke, experiment, record, explain, or try out a media.\n\nIn the second two weeks, we\u2019ll invite the images to deliberately and intentionally carry meaning and communication through relational moves like juxtaposition, composition, and context. We\u2019ll look at developing and expanding the range of approaches for putting things together by composing page spreads with your images. Since nothing exists without context, we look at how to intentionally drive the image\u2019s connotations, meanings, and associations generated through elements of composition and \u201cvisual contrasts.\u201d Ultimately, we will take the images that you create and make a book from them.\n\nThe results of your assignments (and experiments) may generate something completely unknowable now or in the future\u2014and that's the goal.",

        "syllabus": "Week 1: Image-based Research\n-Welcome! This week we will introduce image-based research and investigate these images in a design context using a range of techniques. You will then choose a subject of your own to research that will become the basis for your experiments and designs in the coming weeks.\n\nWeek 2: Making Images\n-This week is a making session! You will take the subject you selected last week and think about it in different ways. From simple to complex, hand to digital, realistic to abstract and everything in between, we'll explore and experiment freely. We'll also consider different modes of representation, and try a hand at creating our own ranges of representation with images.\n\nWeek 3: Composition is Relational\n-In this third week, we will define and investigate core principles of composition, and begin to compose simple spreads for your book.\n\nWeek 4: Designing a Book with Your Images\n-In this final week, we will pull together your work from the previous weeks to make spreads using 10-20 of your favorite images from your assignments and compile them into a 8-page book. I am also sharing with you a few image-based books to give you some ideas on how to structure your book. Note that for the final assignment I am asking you to submit a digital book through Issuu (instructions are included in the assignment). If you choose to create your images by hand, you will still need a computer loaded with InDesign or a similar program to clean up the images and prepare the files for upload to the Coursera platform.",

This class has been taught for seventeen years at Stony Brook University, and is an accessible introduction to combining arts and computing.*\nFor programming we will be using the free and open source programming language and integrated development environment, Processing. The course will provide the essentials of programming in a visual context, allowing you to visualize, design, and create generative art with Processing.\nFor visuals we will cover Photoshop CS5 and GIMP, which is a free open-source tool offering the same functionality as Photoshop. Whether you have access to one or the other, you will learn how to create and manipulate digital images, and most importantly, you will become comfortable enough to expand on what you learn here, after the end of our course.\nFor sound we will teach both Logic and Soundation. Logic is Apple\u2019s DAW or Digital Audio Workstation while Soundation is a free web-based multi-track audio editor. We\u2019ll be teaching the basics of digital audio\u2013including recording, and automating effects.",

In these first 4 Modules you will gain the knowledge and the confidence that will help you make good choices as you consider qualities of the camera you own, and the qualities of the other types of digital cameras you might be considering. You will learn about the basic functions that most digital cameras have in common. You will also go beyond the \"technical\" matters and learn about how you can make exciting pictures by emphasizing the aspects of Frame and Vantage Point to interpret old subjects in new ways. Discovering accessories that photographers find useful, and the types of camera bags from mini to carry-on sized, is also in store for you. You will also make your first photographs and, if you are a subscriber to the specialization, upload pictures to the web gallery and start interacting with your fellow learners in our \"Gallery.\" Let's get started with Module One!",

The world of digital photography presents so many \"tech\" options that it can be quite confusing. Throughout this Course and Specialization, we will be sorting through the various functions, menus, and also the good old focus and exposure and camera craft aspects, so you can build a foundation for success. We'll start with some Basics, and keep building!\n\nCamera capabilities: differences and similarities\n-In Module Two we will survey different types of digital cameras that are in widespread use today, discuss their different capabilities and characteristics, and help you determine which might be most appropriate for the uses you plan to make of your photographs. Whether you need to make photographs to capture the important moments of personal experience with friends and family, or need to make photographs for purposes related to your employment or small business, you will find an overview of information to help you here. Along with the time you spend learning about cameras, you should continue to experiment with your own camera and your own interest in photography!\n\nSetting up yourself and your digital camera: Menus, Settings, and baggage!\n-In Module Three you will be guided through the critical steps of \"Setting Up\" your Digital Camera. Digital cameras of all types offer many options to choose from, allowing you to customize the way the pictures are recorded and to be more successful in achieving your goals in photography. This is NOT just a checklist of functions, simply guiding you as to which buttons to push! You will learn the practical significance of what the settings mean and how they impact the way a picture looks, and how your camera works. You will understand not only HOW but also WHY! Whether you have a brand new camera or have been making digital photographs for a while, this information is critical to your success.\n\nPicture Decisions: The Vantage Point and Frame\n-In Module Four we will turn to concepts related to the way photographs look, and how practical decisions that are unique to photography can have dramatic effect in terms of what their creative content might be. We examine the aspects of Vantage Point and Frame as essential choices that must be made by photographers no matter what their ultimate goal for image-making. We also introduce the Peer Review process for paid-Learners, and the ways we can learn about our own ideas through using \"terms of art\" in written reviews the photographs of fellow Learners.",

        "description": "Welcome to Course One of Photography Basics and Beyond: From Smartphone to DSLR! In these first 4 Modules you will gain the knowledge and the confidence that will help you make good choices as you consider qualities of the camera you own, and the qualities of the other types of digital cameras you might be considering. You will learn about the basic functions that most digital cameras have in common.  You will also go beyond the &quot;technical&quot; matters and learn about how you can make exciting pictures by emphasizing the aspects of Frame and Vantage Point to interpret old subjects in new ways.  Discovering accessories that photographers find useful, and the types of camera bags from mini to carry-on sized, is also in store for you.  You will also make your first photographs and, if you are a subscriber to the specialization, upload pictures to the web gallery and start interacting with your fellow learners in our &quot;Gallery.&quot;  Let&#039;s get started with Module One!",

Also in this class I have several complete analysis projects that we will complete together - just like in my college classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this class, we will cover:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;My approach to Music Theory&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tools of Counterpoint&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Second Species Counterpoint&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Metric Accents and Diminutions &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Resolutions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Passing Tones&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consonant Skips and Leaps&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neighbor Tones&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Writing Compelling Melodies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Third Species Counterpoint&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Cambiata&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Double Neighbor Tones&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fourth Species Counterpoint&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rhythmic Displacement&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Suspensions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;4-3, 7-6, and 9-8 Suspension Types&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consonant Suspensions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chains of Suspensions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fifth Species Counterpoint&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Free Counterpoint&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Worksheets and Music for Practice&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;...and much, much more!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will not have another opportunity to learn Music Theory in a more comprehensive way than this. Start here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Jason Allen is an Ableton Certified Trainer, and a PhD in Music Composition and master of Electronic Sounds. His music has been heard internationally in film, radio, video games, and industrial sound, as well as the concert hall and theater. His 2015 album, &lt;/em&gt;Aniscorcia, &lt;em&gt;reaching the CMJ Top200 Charts and radio broadcasts nationwide. In 2014 he was named a semi-finalist for the Grammy Music Educator Award.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He currently as an adjunct professor of composition at the University of St. Thomas, and the CEO of Slam Academy in Minneapolis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Praise for classes by Dr. Jason Allen:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Without a doubt the best explanation and east of use that one can get. It leaves you enough room to go explore. The classes go by quick, so you can be on your way at being proficient. What are you wait for!&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Amazing - Seriously Loved It! I took all his courses and have to say I&#039;m so happy! Learnt loads! Jason is an awesome teacher!&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;I have never had any formal training in music at all. Trying to learn all the notes and how everything translated was a serious challenge. After going through this class, Dr. J has totally brought down the barriers. The content was very useful and was easy to grasp for me.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;I like these courses because you can get up and running quickly without having to spend hours of time wading through TMI (too much information!). Jason hits the high points but shows you what you need to know. Thanks!&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;I&#039;ve watched many other videos on scales and chords before, however, this one has been the best. I now understand minor scales and chords and even how to analyze songs. It really gave me the confidence to start producing music because I feel like I have some structure and guidelines to follow. AWESOME!&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Clear and Informative - Jason has a clear uncluttered style (with the important dashes of humor) of presentation that is focused on the important key aspects of this course. Recommended for those starting out!&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Dr. Allen does it again with his music theory series. This course really opened up everything I learned from the 1st section, and now I understand more about the composition side of things for music. I highly highly recommend this course to anyone!!! Really opened my eyes to many things I wasn&#039;t aware of.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;The Best Teacher Ever, who makes you understand the ins &amp; outs of Music Theory by all means without giving what you don&#039;t want to know.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;",

        "syllabus": "BIENVENIDA\n-\u00a1Bienvenido al curso! Aqu\u00ed trataremos todos los detalles acerca del curso y lo que necesitar\u00e1 saber para aprovechar al m\u00e1ximo su experiencia.\n\nLA IMPROVISACI\u00d3N COMO IDIOMA\n-Dado que todos los que toman este curso comienzan desde un lugar diferente en t\u00e9rminos de experiencia como improvisadores, es importante que primero tratemos algunos materiales b\u00e1sicos. Comenzaremos nuestro viaje explorando el lenguaje utilizado por los improvisadores de jazz. La improvisaci\u00f3n se asemeja al lenguaje en muchas formas. Con la m\u00fasica, adquirimos fluidez cuando el vocabulario (escalas y acordes) y la gram\u00e1tica (progresiones arm\u00f3nicas) son asimiladas al contenido de una conversaci\u00f3n o historia (temas mel\u00f3dicos y estructura), y ya no tenemos que pensar de manera consciente en ellos mientras tocamos.\n\nEL VOCABULARIO DEL IMPROVISADOR\n-En esta lecci\u00f3n analizaremos la jerga del improvisador. Identificaremos las escalas de acordes m\u00e1s comunes y el tipo de armon\u00eda con el cual se relacionan, incluida mayor, menor y la 7a. de dominante.\n\nC\u00d3MO ELEGIR ESCALAS EN TIEMPO REAL\n-Los improvisadores deben poder recordar con rapidez las escalas de acordes y tocarlas con fluidez. Esto adquiere importancia cuando se elige qu\u00e9 escala de acordes usar en una armon\u00eda determinada -otra cosa que debemos poder determinar de inmediato. Cuando recibimos una nueva melod\u00eda en una sesi\u00f3n o ensayo, no hay tiempo para llevarnos la m\u00fasica a casa y dedicar una hora o dos a trabajar en las escalas correctas. Los improvisadores necesitan una forma r\u00e1pida y mayormente intuitiva de elegir las escalas en tiempo real, mientras est\u00e1 sonando la melod\u00eda. Esta semana analizaremos mi m\u00e9todo para tomar estas r\u00e1pidas decisiones musicales.\n\nARMON\u00cdA PARA IMPROVISADORES\n-Es importante que un improvisador implique con claridad las armon\u00edas cuando improvisa. No es suficiente que simplemente toque las notas correctas en cada acorde. En esta lecci\u00f3n analizaremos de qu\u00e9 manera el improvisador ayuda a las armon\u00edas a moverse. Parte del trabajo del improvisador es ayudar al oyente a seguir los cambios a medida que los acordes se mueven de unos a otros.\n\nTEMA Y VARIACI\u00d3N\n-Esta semana analizaremos de qu\u00e9 manera el improvisador desarrolla temas mel\u00f3dicos en un pasaje solista. Tal como se mencion\u00f3 en la semana 1, existen comparaciones naturales entre el discurso y la improvisaci\u00f3n que muestran c\u00f3mo funciona esto. La t\u00e9cnica m\u00e1s com\u00fan para contar una historia musical que atraiga al oyente mientras dure su solo es utilizar un concepto tradicional llamado tema y variaci\u00f3n. Esto es, usted introduce un tema -una frase musical- y luego lo repite con variaciones para desarrollar un argumento interesante. Un buen solo es como una explicaci\u00f3n, o una buena historia. La explicaci\u00f3n o historia es el contenido de la improvisaci\u00f3n.",

In this course, you'll gain a better understanding of the scope of design and the role it plays in our day to day life.\nThe course invites curious parties, potential future designers, as well as those interested in adjacent domains, to engage with current discourses around design theory, as these are presented in design academic circles internationally. It offers students both an in-depth understanding of these issues and key analytical tools for further thinking.",

Recently, it has entered into a process of transformation, moving from a species of pulp fiction on the margins of children\u2019s literature to an autonomous genre, one Will Eisner labeled the graphic novel. This transformation has been noted in such literary venues as the New York Times and the New Yorker, as well as in an increasing number of university classrooms and bookstore shelves.\n\n\u201cComic Books and Graphic Novels\u201d presents a survey of the history of American comics and a review of major graphic novels circulating in the U. S. today. It is focused on three main points. First, it argues that as comics develop in concert with, and participate in literary culture, they should be considered literature. Second, it reasons that such a designation forces us to redefine our concept of literature itself. Finally, it explores this transformative literary world by arguing that comics have much to teach us about ourselves.\n\nGet started by enrolling in an upcoming session, then print out the official course playset and get started!",

Before you start this course we invite you to first go through the introduction and introduce yourself in the forum to meet your fellow learners. If you encounter any difficulties while studying, please let us know in the forum. For technical difficulties or questions regarding the course certificate, you can always contact the Coursera Learner Helpdesk. Good luck and we hope you will enjoy studying in this course!\n\nMusic and Atmosphere\nWhat do you think about background music? Does it disturb you or does it create a nice atmosphere? Do you think there is too much music played all day long? And why do people play music? In this first module we will basically discuss and reflect on three interrelated items: (1) How and why music is omnipresent in our contemporary society; (2) Music's influence on the specific atmosphere of a space; (3) How music affects and is affected by other societal developments.\n\nMusic and Identity\nHow does music affect identity and how does identity influence music? Is music only an expression of personal taste or is there more to say about this relation? In this module we will discuss and explore the relation between music and identity. We'll do this by discussing (1) how music influences personal identity and (2) how music influences collective identity and (3) how the 'structure of society' influences music as well as identity.\n\n\nIn this module we will investigate and discuss the relation between music and politics: how music affects politics and how it is affected by politics. Music may support political organizations and governmental institutions, it has the power to discipline the behavior of groups and individuals, but it can also act as a form of protest against a political status quo or dominant (political) discourses.\n\n\nIn this module we will explore the relation between music and ethics. Music influences behavior and certain judgments of behavior are ethical judgments. We will explore the relation between aesthetic good and ethical good music. We will discuss how hospitality can evoke a fruitful attitude towards music. We will discuss the role of music in human flourishing.",

        "syllabus": "What Is Design Thinking?\n-Welcome to the course -- we're excited you're here! We will begin by unpacking what we mean by design thinking and why it is more effective than traditional methods when the goal is innovation. By looking at the case history of The Good Kitchen, a Denmark program for providing meals for the elderly, we will explore how the mindset and practice of the innovation team that partnered with innovation consultant Hatch & Bloom enabled them to achieve innovation and growth. We\u2019ll also examine what kinds of challenges are best-suited for design thinking and learn about the Visualization tool, which helps bring ideas to life. By the end of this module, you'll have a better understanding of what we mean by design thinking, when to use it, and how to use the Visualization tool.\n\nPreparing Your Mind for Innovation\n-Design thinking is not only about process and tools, it is about people as well: about you as a design thinker and about the people you want to create value for and with. And so, before we jump into the process of using design thinking to generate and test ideas, we want to first focus on your mindset, and look at whether your mind is prepared to both see and act on opportunity when it shows up in your world. We will examine this issue by looking at the stories of two very capable managers, George and Geoff, and how their differing mindsets affect their ability to lead innovation and growth. We'll also learn about the value of the Storytelling tool. By the end of this module, you'll have a better understanding of a mind prepared to see and take action when opportunity arises, and how to use the Storytelling tool.\n\nIdea Generation\n-Now we will dive deeper into the design thinking process, looking at how we can use it to generate better ideas. In this module, we will look at the story of an entrepreneur, Chris Cartter, and his start-up, MeYouHealth, as they worked with Boston design firm, Essential Design, to understand the kind of opportunity that social networking might hold for helping us to improve our health. Examining what already exists is the first step in the design thinking process. As part of assessing \"what is?\", designers \u201cfollow the customer home\u201d and explore the problems they are trying to solve in life versus their product use. Once they have thoroughly explored and looked for patterns, designers look toward the future and ask \"what if?\" This is the creative part of the process, but it also requires a disciplined approach. By the end of this module, you'll understand how to use design thinking to generate innovative ideas, how to apply the \"what is?\" and \"what if?\" questions, and how to use the Mind Mapping tool.\n\nExperimentation\n-Having generated all of these innovative ideas, what\u2019s next? The design thinking process now helps us to take the many ideas we have generated and figure out how to determine which ones are likely to produce the specific kinds of outcomes we want, whether these take the form of improved nutrition for the elderly (e.g., The Good Kitchen), healthier lifestyle choices (e.g., MeYouHealth) or even more \u201chot leads\u201d emanating from your trade shows (as in the IBM example to follow). In this module, we will follow the activities of an IBM team working closely with experience marketing agency George P. Johnson as they develop and test ideas for a revolutionary approach to trade show participation. This process begins by asking \"what wows?\". This question brings together the customer and business cases supporting our new concepts. Typically, the \u201cwow\u201d zone occurs at the intersection of three criteria: 1) somebody wants it, 2) we can create and deliver it, and 3) doing so has the potential to produce the outcomes we want. Then we ask \"what works?\" and conduct small experiments to test if our assumptions are accurate. By the end of this module, you'll understand how to apply the \"what wows?\" and \"what works?\" questions, and how to use the Learning Launch tool. We'll conclude by reviewing our lessons and discussing strategic opportunities.\n\nFinal Assignment\n-This module hosts materials related to your final assignment for the course. The assignment requires selecting one of the design thinking tools presented in the course, writing a reflection, and completing three peer reviews. To successfully complete the course, you must complete and pass the final assignment.",

Si tratta di un intervento che non mira a realizzare una nuova opera, ma che, partendo da un\u2019architettura che appartiene al patrimonio della nostra memoria, tende a conservarne i valori storici e culturali, ma anche tecnici e materici.\nIl corso si articola in lezioni teoriche ex-cattedra e seminari che illustrano il contemporaneo dibattito teorico sul restauro architettonico, le tecniche di consolidamento e la normativa vigente in materia di adeguamento funzionale e beni culturali. Sono previste inoltre esercitazioni in aula per ciascuna fase del progetto di restauro e sopralluoghi in cantiere e nel laboratorio dei materiali del Dipartimento di Strutture per l\u2019ingegneria e l\u2019architettura. Alla fine di ogni fase, revisioni generali periodiche permetteranno un migliore svolgimento del tema d\u2019anno.\nLo scopo che si prefigge il corso \u00e8 quello di formare una figura di architetto sensibile all\u2019individuazione dei valori storici, artistici e materici del patrimonio costruito cos\u00ec da poter condurre un progetto di restauro finalizzato alla conservazione e alla valorizzazione di tali valori. In fase di esame finale verr\u00e0 valutata la consapevolezza raggiunta dal candidato su come operare sul patrimonio culturale esistente e la sua capacit\u00e0 di attuare scelte in linea con il dibattito attuale sul restauro e tecniche di intervento rispettose dei valori dell\u2019edificio.",

Remember that you are able to watch the lectures as many times as you like, at whatever pace is comfortable for you.\nAs I\u2019ve done with the first two sets of Beethoven lectures, I look forward to meeting with students\u2014online and in person, in various cities. The dates and locations will be posted in the Announcements and Events section, as part of the course content. So please remember to check back there for details.\n\nIn these four new lectures, we will explore the following sonatas:\n\u2022 Sonata Op. 10, No. 1\n\u2022 Sonata Op. 22\n\u2022 Sonata Op. 31, No. 2\n\u2022 Sonata Opp. 78, 79, 81a\n\n\nThe Dolfinger-McMahon Foundation supports Curtis\u2019s lifelong learning initiatives.",

        "syllabus": "welcome to class\n-We are glad that you have joined us for Part 3 of Exploring Beethoven's Piano Sonatas course, taught by Curtis faculty member and extraordinary concert artist, Jonathan Biss! This course is considered Part 3, with new and separate sets of lectures. Specifically, in Part 3 we will cover Beethoven's Piano Sonatas Op. 10, No. 1, Op. 22, Op. 31, No. 2 and Opp. 78, 79 and 81a. As with the other two Beethoven courses, it is not necessary to have taken the previous Exploring Beethoven's Piano Sonatas courses. We know you will be perfectly comfortable to start learning with Part 3, if you wish and go from here. There is always the option to go back to Parts 1 and 2 at any time. Between these two courses, there exists a large amount of additional resources and learning that might be helpful as you embark on Part 3. We certainly encourage you to take Parts 1 and 2, if you have not just yet. In the meantime, enjoy the class: Part 3 of Exploring Beethoven\u2019s Piano Sonatas.\n\nOp. 10 No. 1\n\nOp. 22\n\nop. 31 no. 2\n\nopp. 78, 79 and 81a\n\nListening to the Sonatas\n-To supplement your learning during the course, enjoy free access to several of the Jonathan's Beethoven Sonatas recordings.\n\nYour Thoughts Welcome",

        "description": "Welcome to Part 3 of Exploring Beethoven&#039;s Piano Sonatas!\n\nI&#039;m delighted to launch another set of new lectures of this course as Part 3. As before, this class is meant for people of all levels of experience with Beethoven&#039;s music (including no experience at all!). Remember that you are able to watch the lectures as many times as you like, at whatever pace is comfortable for you.\nAs I\u2019ve done with the first two sets of Beethoven lectures, I look forward to meeting with students\u2014online and in person, in various cities. The dates and locations will be posted in the Announcements and Events section, as part of the course content. So please remember to check back there for details. \n\nIn these four new lectures, we will explore the following sonatas: \n\u2022 Sonata Op. 10, No. 1\n\u2022 Sonata Op. 22\n\u2022 Sonata Op. 31, No. 2\n\u2022 Sonata Opp. 78, 79, 81a\n\n\nThe Dolfinger-McMahon Foundation supports Curtis\u2019s lifelong learning initiatives.",

Before you begin the course, we will cover all the details about the course and what you'll need to know to get the most out of your Berklee MOOC.\n\nAcoustic / Electric Guitar and the Basics\n-In this first lesson, we will take things slow. We will focus on how to choose the right guitar for you and what accessories are essential for any guitar player. We'll also learn the parts of the guitar and get you comfortable with your instrument.\n\nGetting Started: Fundamental Guitar Skills\n-In this lesson, you will learn how to tune and you will start playing your instrument from the ground up! Be patient and remember: focus on being accurate and play in consistent time with your metronome. These things are far more important than playing with speed.\n\nThe Twelve Half Steps and Basic Notation\n-While you don\u2019t need to be an expert on music theory to play guitar, it is important to know the basic building blocks of music. With this understanding, music will no longer be shrouded in mystery or complexity. This lesson presents fundamental musical ideas in a fun, non-intimidating way.\n\nScales: Construction and Fingerings\n-In this lesson, you will dig into scales. Don\u2019t be intimidated. Some of you may have heard of, or practiced, scales. It might have been during piano lessons. Most likely it wasn\u2019t very exciting for you. Hopefully you'll find the approach to scales in lesson 4 much easier and even fun.\n\nChords: Building Easy Triads and Power Cords\n-In this lesson, you will use all of the skills you\u2019ve gained from the previous lessons to build the foundation of harmony. You will play certain scale notes at the same time to create chords. Let's look at why chords sound like they do, how to build them, how to easily play chords in open position, and how to play chords that you can move all around the neck.\n\nPutting it All Together: The Pentatonic Scale and Songs\n-Now that you have the \"science\" of the guitar in your fingers, you will learn a couple of songs. You will do this by using melody (from the scales) and harmony (from the chords) we have learned. You will also learn an essential scale for playing melodies and soloing.",

        "overview": "Examine how architecture reflects Japan\u2019s history, starting with its emergence as a new nation in the 19th century and the building of the Western-style capital city of Tokyo on the foundations of Edo. New building materials and construction methods reflected changing times, and the radical contrast between tradition and modernism in the nation was clearly visible in Japan\u2019s architecture and politics.\nWhile experiencing intense Westernization pressures, Japan developed rapidly to rival the world\u2019s great powers, we will look at how Japanese architects developed their own version of Modernism. Initially, Japanese wanted to pursue the discoveries of the Franco-Swiss Le Corbusier and of Walter Gropius at the German Bauhaus. But soon, Japan also began to produce its own 20th-century architects and develop its own style. Following World War II, Kenzo Tange became the first Japanese architect in history to achieve international fame.\nIn the last section of the course, we will present an interview-based case study titled \u201cExploring Tokyo Tech\u2019s Twenty-First Century O-okayama Campus.\u201d Tokyo Institute of Technology (aka Tokyo Tech) possesses its own unique and unbroken succession of practicing architects/professors, who design campus buildings. We will learn about Professor Kazuo Shinohara, one of the most prominent Japanese designers of the second half of the 20th century, and several of his renowned disciples from Tokyo Tech.",

        "overview": "Descripci\u00f3n de curso\nGracias por tu inter\u00e9s. Aunque este MOOC ya se realiz\u00f3, si te inscribes podr\u00e1s acceder a los contenidos m\u00e1s importantes y a los v\u00eddeos. Sin embargo, no podr\u00e1s realizar ninguna de las actividades ni te podr\u00e1s certificar. Cuando est\u00e9 disponible una nueva edici\u00f3n podr\u00e1s inscribirte para que obtengas la experiencia completa de un MOOC de Mir\u00edadax.\n\nCon este curso pretendemos proporcionar las herramientas b\u00e1sicas necesarias para entender la funci\u00f3n del arte p\u00fablico que se ubica en el escenario urbano como lugar de pr\u00e1cticas art\u00edsticas. El espectador, en nuestro caso el alumno/a inscrito/a en el MOOC, se ve implicado a participar de esta modalidad de arte pasando de ser un mero observador pasivo en una sala expositiva a un ciudadano participante de un hecho social al que se adhiere por su comprensi\u00f3n y solidaridad con lo que all\u00ed se est\u00e1 manifestando. Una vez tratado un tema general sobre arte y espacio p\u00fablico en la primera semana, abordaremos tres m\u00f3dulos que versar\u00e1n sobre problemas de la sociedad: la especulaci\u00f3n urbana frente a la conservaci\u00f3n de restos arqueol\u00f3gicos, el arte urbano participativo / colaborativo y la arquitectura y g\u00e9nero. Cada tema se plantear\u00e1 como un problema en la sociedad actual, se presentar\u00e1n artistas y sus obras que lo aborden y expondremos un proyecto personal relacionado con ese aspecto concreto dentro del arte p\u00fablico",

        "overview": "There is nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has come. This course is designed to help you materialize your game-changing idea and transform it into a product that you can build a business around. Product Design blends theory and practice to teach you product validation, UI/UX practices, Google\u2019s Design Sprint and the process for setting and tracking actionable metrics.\n\n\nWhy Take This Course?\nOver the years, Silicon Valley startups have developed a series of frameworks and best practices for product design. Through startup case studies and interviews with industry experts, we want to bring you the best of Silicon Valley with lessons you can apply to influence the design of your mobile or web app.\nBy the end of the course, you will know how to perform a Google Design Sprint (developed at Google Ventures and exclusively taught in this course) to design, prototype and test your ideas. You will also learn to design low fidelity mockups for your product and capture appropriate metrics.",

This lesson will help you develop, validate and refine your ideas to ensure you\u2019re building for a product/market fit. Through case studies and interviews with founders, product experts, and investors, you will learn how to efficiently conduct user research and build an entrepreneurial mindset.\nLesson 2: UI/UX\nThey say good design shrinks the gap between what a product does and why it exists. This lesson takes you beyond visual style to understand material design, building for accessibility, user flows and personas. You\u2019ll hear about how startups make design decisions and learn from senior designers at Google on how they use design to emphasize the purpose of their products.\nBy the end of the lesson, you will analyze the user experience of another product and start documenting a user flow for your own product.",

The course utilises an overhead camera to show you exactly what is being played. So firstly it is a \u201cHow To\u201d course: \u201cWatch what is being played - now try it yourself\u201d. In addition it relies on using \u201cplayalongs\u201d, that is pre-recorded bass and drum tracks which you can play along with. The course concentrates on the blues first and then looks at playing a jazz standard.\nThis course is for any interested pianist, but may be of particular interest to university or college piano students studying music.\nYou\u2019ll need to have access to a piano or keyboard and a computer, tablet or smart phone set up next to it.",

However, animation training is expensive due to the high cost of proprietary animation software.\nThis course is designed using an open source 3D animation tool: Blender, to create a sustainable solution for animation skill development. Individuals interested in developing skill sets for 3D animation should take this course in order to learn the nuances of 3D animation and Blender. The course has 4 weeks of content, which cover the basics of key-framing, timing, and animation principles.\nThe course comprises slow paced video tutorials, quizzes, activities, and hands-on assignments. During the course the learners will be creating simple animation motion, using Blender as a tool. The course has video tutorials explaining the concepts and the software process required to create these animations. The tutorials are designed such that the learners will be able to apply these concepts to create similar/new animations.\nThis course focuses only on animation of non-organic objects (not covering character animation), as the education domain requires motion of such objects.",

        "overview": "Architecture is the crystallization of the spirit of its age, and this certainly applies to the architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright (1867 \u2013 1959). Wright pioneered Modern Architecture in response to industrialization, new materials, and changes in society. Then he created a new home for the 20th century in response to the decentering brought about by the end of perspective painting, the end of absolute space and time in physics, and end of a privileged position for humans in science and society. And Wright created a new notion of who we can be as human beings, bringing together the individual of the West, and the integration in the flow of nature of the East.\nBefore Wright, most architecture was based on the past, as we see, for example in the Beaux Arts that referred back to ancient Rome. After Wright, architecture, including that of the leading European Modern Architects, was based on an honest expression of the functions, spaces, materials, and structure of a building. Wright worked in the Midwestern United States, a region that prided itself on being remote Europe, where he developed a uniquely American, modern, and democratic architecture.\nWe begin with a brief overview of Wright\u2019s work, a biographical sketch, and a look at the architecture at the time he began his career. Then we go into some depth on each of Wright\u2019s major works: his Prairie Style houses, Fallingwater, Johnson Wax, the Guggenheim Museum, and more.",

Art can be a powerful catalyst for building skills and understanding across a wide range of subjects. Establish your foundation by watching each module's video lectures and reviewing the required readings, artworks, and additional resources. Then, test your knowledge with the quizzes and be sure to comment on videos and post in the discussion forums to share your thoughts.\n\nActivities for Analyzing and Reflecting\nIn this module, we\u2019re moving from theory to practice, with videos that discuss drawing, sound, movement, writing, and game-based activities that build skills for analyzing and reflecting about art. Most videos touch upon a variety of methods, while the Take Action segments are in-depth demonstrations of specific activities. You\u2019ll get the most out of these videos by actually doing the activities yourself. We encourage you to snap a photo of something you\u2019ve made in response to a Take Action prompt, and then share it in the discussion forums.\n\nActivities for Creating, Imagining & Connecting\nIn this module, we\u2019ll stay active by covering activities that involve drawing, writing, discussion, sound, and movement. We\u2019ll also put on our designer hats, with a Take Action video that presents a cosmic design challenge. You\u2019ll have a chance to test your knowledge with the third and final quiz of the course. Finally, we want you to put all that you\u2019ve learned into practice by using one of the activities with family, friends, or students, and then reflecting on the experience in the discussion forums.\n\n\nIn this module, we shift the focus from activities to assessment. There are two videos; one that emphasizes self-assessment for you as the facilitator, and a second on assessing student work. Additionally, we have assigned two readings that support the video lectures, which you should complete before stating the final project.",

        "syllabus": "Introduction to Image and Video Processing\n-In this module we look at images and videos as 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) signals, and discuss their analog/digital dichotomy. We will also see how the characteristics of an image changes depending on its placement over the electromagnetic spectrum, and how this knowledge can be leveraged in several applications.\n\nSignals and Systems\n-In this module we introduce the fundamentals of 2D signals and systems. Topics include complex exponential signals, linear space-invariant systems, 2D convolution, and filtering in the spatial domain.\n\nFourier Transform and Sampling\n-In this module we look at 2D signals in the frequency domain. Topics include: 2D Fourier transform, sampling, discrete Fourier transform, and filtering in the frequency domain.\n\nMotion Estimation\n-In this module we cover two important topics, motion estimation and color representation and processing. Topics include: applications of motion estimation, phase correlation, block matching, spatio-temporal gradient methods, and fundamentals of color image processing\n\nImage Enhancement\n-In this module we cover the important topic of image and video enhancement, i.e., the problem of improving the appearance or usefulness of an image or video. Topics include: point-wise intensity transformation, histogram processing, linear and non-linear noise smoothing, sharpening, homomorphic filtering, pseudo-coloring, and video enhancement.\n\nImage Recovery: Part 1\n-In this module we study the problem of image and video recovery. Topics include: introduction to image and video recovery, image restoration, matrix-vector notation for images, inverse filtering, constrained least squares (CLS), set-theoretic restoration approaches, iterative restoration algorithms, and spatially adaptive algorithms.\n\nImage Recovery : Part 2\n-In this module we look at the problem of image and video recovery from a stochastic perspective. Topics include: Wiener restoration filter, Wiener noise smoothing filter, maximum likelihood and maximum a posteriori estimation, and Bayesian restoration algorithms.\n\nLossless Compression\n-In this module we introduce the problem of image and video compression with a focus on lossless compression. Topics include: elements of information theory, Huffman coding, run-length coding and fax, arithmetic coding, dictionary techniques, and predictive coding.\n\nImage Compression\n-In this module we cover fundamental approaches towards lossy image compression. Topics include: scalar and vector quantization, differential pulse-code modulation, fractal image compression, transform coding, JPEG, and subband image compression.\n\nVideo Compression\n-In this module we discus video compression with an emphasis on motion-compensated hybrid video encoding and video compression standards including H.261, H.263, H.264, H.265, MPEG-1, MPEG-2, and MPEG-4.\n\nImage and Video Segmentation\n-In this module we introduce the problem of image and video segmentation, and discuss various approaches for performing segmentation including methods based on intensity discontinuity and intensity similarity, watersheds and K-means algorithms, and other advanced methods.\n\nSparsity\n-In this module we introduce the notion of sparsity and discuss how this concept is being applied in image and video processing. Topics include: sparsity-promoting norms, matching pursuit algorithm, smooth reformulations, and an overview of the applications.",

        "overview": "While Italian opera set the standard in the Baroque era, German composer George Frederic Handel quickly gained popularity for his oratorios, which put operatic techniques to work in the service of sacred music. Handel\u2019s Messiah premiered in Dublin on April 13, 1742, and remains popular to this day. Harvard\u2019s Thomas Forrest Kelly (Morton B. Knafel Professor of Music) guides learners through Messiah\u2019s musical highlights, while detailing Handel\u2019s composition process, the preparations and rehearsals, and the premiere performance.\nLearners in this module of First Nights need not have any prior musical experience. In this unit, you will learn the basics of musical form and analysis, the genres and styles used in Messiah, the circumstances of its first performance, and its subsequent history.\nAdditional First Nights Modules:\nMonteverdi's L'Orfeo and the Birth of Opera\nHandel\u2019s Messiah and Baroque Oratorio\nBeethoven's \"Ninth Symphony\"\nBerlioz\u2019s Symphonie Fantastique and Program Music in the 19th Century\nIgor Stravinsky\u2019s The Rite of Spring: Modernism, Ballet, and Riots\n ",

        "overview": "Where is Giza? How were the Pyramids built? How did the cemeteries and hundreds of decorated tombs around them develop? What was Giza\u2019s contribution to this first great age of ancient Egyptian civilization, the Old Kingdom?\n\nThe Giza Plateau and its cemeteries \u2014 including the majestic Pyramids and the Great Sphinx \u2014 are stirring examples of ancient Egyptian architecture and culture. They provide windows into ancient Egyptian society, but also contain mysteries waiting to be solved. The Egyptian Pyramids at Giza provide an opportunity to explore the history of archaeology and to learn about some of the modern methods shaping the discipline today.\n\nThis introductory course will explore the art, archaeology, and history surrounding the Giza Pyramids. We will learn about Egyptian pharaohs and high officials of the Pyramid Age, follow in the footsteps of the great 20th-century expeditions, and discover how cutting-edge digital tools like 3D-modeling are reshaping the discipline of Egyptology.\n\nJoin us on this online journey to ancient Egypt\u2019s most famous archaeological site as we uncover the history and significance of Giza, and use new digital techniques to unravel the mysteries of its ancient tombs and temples.",

In this module, we will cover all the details about how this course works and what you'll need to know to get the most out of your course experience.\n\nNatural Vocal Design: How Vocal Producers Create\n-By the end of this lesson you will understand vocal placement within the stereo field and how recording a vocalist multiple times can create various types of listening experiences. You will understand level, phase, phantom center, panning, balance, equalization and compression concepts used in modern recordings. Your ability to listen to music will be expanded and you will probably never listen to vocals in music the same way ever again once you have been exposed to these simple concepts\n\nArtificial Vocal Design: How Vocal Producers \u201cSweeten\u201d the Creation\n-In this lesson, we will lean less on the vocalist and more on tools that can be used to change the way we listen to vocals in music. You will now understand how delays and reverbs have been used in the music you love and their relationship to time and tempo. Your desire to try out some of these techniques will be piqued by the time you finish this lesson.\n\nVocal Time Compression and Expansion: Tools of the Trade\n-In this lesson the nature of the DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) will be demystified and simplified. You will understand time as an absolute concept, time as a relative concept and further grasp the utility of the sample rate and bit depth parameters in your audio software. You will be shown tools that can change a song from a ballad to a dance record and vice versa. Many modern vocal production tools exist in software that might already be on your computer; but if you do not have such tools, you will document the use of these concepts via in-depth analysis of current and emerging music.\n\nVocal Pitch Correction and Tuning: More tools of the Trade\n-In this lesson, you will learn some of the industry standard pitch correction and tuning tools. Although you will gain an understanding and appreciation of how easy the job of a vocalist can be when these tools are used, you will also learn that your first lesson in simple performance and placement is still the most potent skill in your art of vocal production arsenal.",

        "overview": "Il corso affronta lo studio di due discipline solo apparentemente lontane da loro. La prima, la pi\u00f9 giovane per codificazione scientifica, avvenuta solo nel XIX secolo, \u00e8 stata denominata \u201cArcheoastronomia\u201d, ovvero la scienza che studia gli allineamenti astronomici di alcuni particolati edifici del passato e il loro significato. Si registra oggi una crescente importanza di tale disciplina da quando architetti, archeologi e studiosi di astronomia si sono resi conto che l\u2019archeoastronomia fornisce una chiave di lettura spesso nuova e inaspettata della forma e della funzione di molti monumenti del passato. Dopo una parte propedeutica di introduzione alla astronomia, in particolar modo ai modelli geometrici usati per lo studio dei suoi fenomeni connessi alle due discipline oggetto del corso, quali ad esempio il movimento apparente del Sole e delle stelle, vengono affrontati alcuni esempi come casi studio. In particolare il corso propone tre ricerche innovative e inedite sul circolo di pietre megalitico di Callanish in Scozia, sulla chiesa Rupestre di San Nicola di Myra nelle vicinanze della citta pugliese di Mottola e sull\u2019osservatorio astronomico Maya di Cichen Itza, dal 1988 patrimonio dell\u2019umanit\u00e0 UNSECO.\nLa seconda parte del corso \u00e8 dedicata alla gnomonica, ovvero la scienza per la costruzione degli orologi solari, che si basa sui medesimi processi geometrici analizzati per il moto apparente del Sole. Il corso ne illustra il funzionamento di una larga gamma di diverse tipologie di orologi solari e fornisce quelle conoscenze indispensabili per poter nuovamente leggere la misura del tempo grazie a questi sofisticati strumenti artistici e, al contempo scientifici, del passato. Vengono inoltre descritte alcune meridiane monumentali della citt\u00e0 di Napoli, costruite entrambe nel XVII secolo ad opera di eminenti studiosi operanti in quei tempi nel fiorente clima culturale della corte del Borboni, la prima collocata nella Certosa di San Martino e la seconda nel Gran Salone del Museo Archeologico Nazionale_MANN.\n***\nThis course combines two independent subjects whose distance from each other\nis only apparent. The first, archeoastronomy, was scientifically codified in the XIXth\ncentury and it is the study of the astronomical alignments of some peculiar buildings\nfrom the past along with their meaning. This discipline has been gaining more and\nmore attention since architects, archeologists and astronomy scholars realized that\narcheoastronomy permits to have a new and unexpected perspective on the shape and functions of many monuments.\nAfter a preparatory introduction to astronomy and to the geometrical models used\nto study the phenomena connected to these two disciplines such as the apparent\nmotion of the sun and the stars, the students will be presented with three innovative\nand unpublished researches on the circle of megalithic stones in Callanish (Scotland),\non Saint Nicholas from Myra rock church near Mottola (Apulia) and on the Mayan\nastronomical observatory of Cichen Itza (Unesco World Heritage Site since 1988).\nThe second part of this course is dedicated to gnomonics, i.e. the study of the\nsundials construction which is based on the same geometrical processes analyzed\nin the apparent motion of the sun. This MOOC will then show how several types of\nsundials work so as to enable the students to read the time through these sophisticated artistic and scientific tools from the past. Moreover, the users will also be introduced to two monumental sundials in Naples that were built in the XVIIth century by the eminent scholars that were then active in the thriving court of the Bourbons: the Charterhouse of Saint Martin\u2019s sundial and the one kept in the Great Hall of the National Archaelogical Museum (MANN).",

Students will then explore call and response techniques and application of the blues scale in improvisation through demonstration with a live musician.\n\n\nKeyboard Realization\n-Lesson 3 introduces the concept of guide tones and its association with invertible counterpoint. Four-part and five-part chords are discussed in detail by exploring their construction and function, as well as techniques to facilitate good voice-leading between chords using chordal inversions.\n\n\n\u201cBird\u201d Blues and Other Blues Progressions\n-In lesson 4 students analyze harmonic progressions from 3 jazz standards: \u201cNow\u2019s The Time,\u201d \u201cBillie\u2019s Bounce,\u201d and \u201cBlues For Alice.\u201d Practice techniques are discussed, including ear-training strategies, rhythmic displacement, and voice-leading exercises.\n\nImprovisational Tools\n-Lesson 5 introduces 3 more jazz standards for analysis: \u201cMr. PC,\u201d \u201cMr. Day,\u201d and \u201cIsotope.\u201d Tritone substitutions are examined, and pentatonic scale as tools in improvisation are introduced through exploration of their construction, typical voicings, and voice-leading principles.\n\nImprovising the Blues \u2013 Part 1\n-Lesson 6 centers around the demonstration of improvisational techniques discussed thus far, including motivic development, guide-tone lines, and chordal arpeggiation. Observation of live Eastman musicians, as well as play-along tracks provided by the rhythm section, allow the student to imitate, assimilate, and apply the techniques discussed in the course.\n\n\nImprovising the Blues \u2013 Part 2\n-Lesson 7 explores modal categories and scalar patterns in improvisation, in addition to continued discussion on pentatonics.

These are indeed powerful, but the universe of social media is much larger. Both online and off, most everything we do has a social component that is mediated by some technology. After all, technologies have been helping people communicate since long before your favorite curly-haired CEO dropped out of college. In this module, you\u2019ll learn about different types of social software, how to think about physical collaboration and digital collaboration using the same framework, and what the challenges to success for collaborative software are.\n\nChallenges & Opportunities of Collaboration Online\n-In our always-on, pervasively connected world, it can seem as if space and distance don\u2019t matter anymore. Indeed, more and more organizations are outsourcing work around the globe and/or opening satellite locations. But being instantly reachable from anywhere in the world, isn\u2019t the same as being there. In this module, you\u2019ll learn the ways that distance does and doesn\u2019t matter, how to design for this reality and how to create technologies that go beyond being there.\n\nCrowdsourcing\n-It can\u2019t possibly work, can it? Slice up challenging problems into tiny pieces, distribute them to people all over the planet, and then gather their responses to piece together a solution. In this module, you\u2019ll learn both the possibilities and limits of crowdsourcing. You\u2019ll learn strategies for being able to use crowdsourcing successfully, and even hear from the voice of a professional crowdworker about what makes it successful from a worker\u2019s perspective. To gain deeper intuitions, you\u2019ll get to try it out yourself in the assignment.",

Il Corso in Disegno tecnico industriale introduce gli studenti all\u2019uso di un nuovo linguaggio di comunicazione tecnica quale il disegno progettuale. Per incuriosire alla disciplina sono stati coinvolti Hockam, Galilei, Leonardo, Sherlock Holmes e Diabolik nell\u2019approfondimento dei temi trattati, con esempi e richiami diretti. Non manca uno sguardo verso le nuove frontiere dell\u2019ingegneria, grazie alla presentazione di casi studio che spaziano dal rilievo dal vero alla stampa 3D, all\u2019impiego della Realt\u00e0 Virtuale in progettazione. Con originalit\u00e0 e rigore, sono introdotti i principali argomenti del corso relativi ai metodi di proiezione ortogonale ed alla quotatura, alle tolleranze dimensionali ed alla rugosit\u00e0, ai collegamenti meccanici ed, infine, all\u2019analisi funzionale di complessivi ed all\u2019interpretazione di un assemblaggio meccanico. Le lezioni fanno ricorso alle potenzialit\u00e0 della piattaforma, permettendo di interagire con i modelli oggetto di studio per comprenderne meglio le caratteristiche e verificare al termine di ogni lezione il livello di apprendimento.",

According to Stravinsky, The Rite of Spring was intended to portray \u201cthe surge of spring, the magnificent upsurge of nature reborn.\u201d As you will see, Stravinsky\u2019s description is almost frighteningly apt!\nHarvard\u2019s Thomas Forrest Kelly (Morton B. Knafel Professor of Music) guides learners through The Rite of Spring, highlighting not only the contributions of Stravinsky, the composer, but also those of his collaborators. Professor Kelly takes learners through the ballet\u2019s development, rehearsals, and finally, premiere performance, and he explores just how and why The Rite of Spring challenged (and to a certain extent, continues to challenge) its listeners.\nYou will learn about the ballet\u2019s innovative choreography, the basics of 20th-century orchestral form and technique, and the circumstances of this ballet\u2019s first performance and subsequent history.

Start here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The course is a roadmap to MAKING STUNNING TRACKS with Ableton Live 10.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All the tools you need to produce great tracks are included in this course and the entire course is based on real-life experiences - not just academic theory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise for Courses by Jason Allen:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u21e2  &lt;em&gt;&quot;It seems like every little detail is being covered in an extremely simple fashion. The learning process becomes relaxed and allows the complex concepts to get obsorbed easily. My only regret is not taking this course earlier.&quot; - &lt;/em&gt;M. Shah&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u21e2  &lt;em&gt;&quot;Great for everyone without any knowledge so far. I bought all three parts... It&#039;s the best investment in leveling up my skills so far..&quot; &lt;/em&gt;- Z. Palce&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u21e2  &lt;em&gt;&quot;Excellent explanations! No more or less than what is needed.&quot; - A. T\u00f3th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u21e2  &lt;em&gt;&quot;VERY COOL. I&#039;ve waiting for years to see a good video course, now I don&#039;t have to wait anymore. Thank You!&quot; - &lt;/em&gt;Jeffrey Koury&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u21e2&lt;em&gt;  &quot;I am learning LOTS! And I really like having the worksheets!&quot; -&lt;/em&gt; A. Deichsel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u21e2 &lt;em&gt; &quot;The basics explained very clearly - loads of really useful tips!&quot;&lt;/em&gt; - J. Pook&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u21e2  &lt;em&gt;&quot;Jason is really quick and great with questions, always a great resource for an online class!&quot; M.

Aseg\u00farate de leerlo inmediatamente y rev\u00edsalo tambi\u00e9n m\u00e1s tarde si hace falta.\n\nEl activismo y movimientos sociales: conferencias, presentaciones por invitados, y prueba\n-Esta parte primera se dedica a la coincidencia prol\u00edfica y emocionante entre el arte socialmente comprometido y las pr\u00e1cticas culturales generadas por los recientes movimientos sociales de todo el mundo. El ambientalismo, el activismo del SIDA, los movimientos queer, el zapatismo, manifestaciones de inmigrantes, altar-globalizaci\u00f3n, el World Social Forum [Foro social mundial], Occupy [Ocupa], el Hong Kong Umbrella Movement [movimiento del paraguas de Hong Kong], boicot de museos, y los levantamientos democr\u00e1ticos en el Medio Oriente se ver\u00e1n en di\u00e1logo con los productores culturales que participan en estos movimientos o est\u00e1n inspirados por ellos. En lugar de evaluar la eficacia pol\u00edtica de tales actividades culturales, vamos a examinar su lugar dentro de las pr\u00e1cticas art\u00edsticas contempor\u00e1neas. Basada en la escucha, la organizaci\u00f3n, el baile, o la fiesta, la contribuci\u00f3n de cada estudiante responder\u00e1 a un movimiento social espec\u00edfico de su elecci\u00f3n para cada uno de sus proyectos.\n\nEl activismo y movimientos sociales: proyecto y evaluaciones: Lesson Choices\n-Choice 1: Inventar o encontrar un chiste relacionado con una cuesti\u00f3n social o movimiento social, y distrib\u00fayelo lo m\u00e1s ampliamente posible. | Choice 2: Crear y distribuir una llamada a acci\u00f3n vinculada a un movimiento social espec\u00edfico\n\nLa est\u00e9tica, la historia del arte, y las instituciones culturales: Conferencias, presentaciones por invitados, y prueba\n-As\u00ed como los movimientos sociales recientes han transformado el arte y la cultura contempor\u00e1neo, activistas han dependido de las ideas desarrolladas en los c\u00edrculos culturales m\u00e1s especializados, a veces sin saberlo. Empezando con una investigaci\u00f3n de las maneras en que el arte p\u00fablico socialmente comprometido ha sido incluido y excluido de algunos narrativas, teor\u00edas, instituciones y eventos, utilizaremos esta lecci\u00f3n para seguir las pr\u00e1cticas sociales que cuestionan el arte e historia del arte convencional. Al hacerlo, les invitar\u00e1 a los estudiantes crear proyectos que se comprometan directamente en el cultivo, la agricultura, la cocina, o comer\u2014actividades que son fundamentalmente sociales, sino que se ve tradicionalmente en contradicci\u00f3n con la producci\u00f3n art\u00edstica seria.\n\nLa est\u00e9tica, la historia del arte, y las instituciones culturales: proyecto y evaluaciones por pares: Lesson Choices\n-Choice 1: Elige una manera de plantar, cultivar, cocinar, o comer con otra gente. Que sea social. Que sea cultural. Que sea pol\u00edtica. | Choice 2: Monta un flashmob en un museo o instituci\u00f3n cultural cerca de ti.\n\nSaberes del cuerpo: conferencias, presentaciones de invitados, y prueba\n-Esta lecci\u00f3n se utilizar\u00e1 el concepto de \u2018saberes del cuerpo\u2019 para vincular el activismo y el arte socialmente comprometido al arte en vivo, los gestos, y \u2018escribir sin palabras.\u2019 Reconociendo que el conocimiento es inseparable de la experiencia vivida, f\u00edsica, y social, \u2018saberes del cuerpo\u2019 cuestionan los paradigmas occidentales que separan la informaci\u00f3n del asunto, raz\u00f3n del afecto, la mente del cuerpo, la trabajadora de su trabajo, el individuo del colectivo. Los componentes pr\u00e1cticos de esta lecci\u00f3n les pidan a los estudiantes que piensen activamente \u2018desde\u2019 su propio sitio de enunciaci\u00f3n y \u2018a trav\u00e9s de\u2019 sus propios saberes del cuerpo.\n\nSaberes del cuerpo: proyecto y evaluaciones por colegas: Lesson Choices\n-Choice 1: Crea una representaci\u00f3n o acci\u00f3n que quiz\u00e1 no entiendas, pero tengas un profundo deseo o necesidad de ejecutar y que puedas repetir durante al menos 5 minutos de cada d\u00eda de esta semana. | Choice 2: Dise\u00f1a una m\u00e1scara para ser utilizada en p\u00fablico, en la luz del d\u00eda, e invite a otros llevarla puesta o llevar su propia a un evento local de flashmob de m\u00e1scaras.\n\nConferenciantes invitados adicionales (opcionales) A-Z",

In Modules 1-4 you will cover the final elements of the Specialization necessary to round out this introduction to the fundamentals of Photography, and prepare you for creating your own exciting project in the Capstone!

Just think of all the information you have absorbed and put to use in your assignments and quizzes, and the confidence you have gained that you CAN control the camera to make pictures you are proud to share.\n\nHere in Course Four you will start by gaining knowledge related to content in photography, from fact to fiction, documentary to purely expressive. Next you will learn principles, tips, and techniques for using the essential element of Light in Ambient/Natural settings.\n\nThe flash/strobe unit, whether it is built-in to your camera or an add-on \"hotshoe\" model, will finally be something you, not the camera, controls! You will prove to yourself that those former mysteries of Controlled Continuous and Strobe lighting will no longer be mysterious, as you apply your knowledge to creation of assignment photographs in various situations. Sharing those pictures in Peer Review will give you the opportunity to learn from your fellow photographers' solutions to lighting challenges, and to gain insight into your own work and creative approaches too.\n\nThere is an important word to share about Peer Review assignments for this course. As photographers who have accomplished the quiz and photography requirements of Courses One through Three, you have the knowledge and capability to create quality photographs at a much higher rate of success, and in a much shorter time, than when you began. You have also proven that you are a dedicated Learner, someone who has a passion for photography and is willing to put forth the extra effort necessary to accomplish your goals. This Course is the last before the Capstone Course, in which you will be tasked with creating a project over a 2-month period of dedicated photography. The Peer Review photography assignments have been structured with both your advanced capabilities and dedication in mind...in other words, they will require both! Be prepared to allocate more time than you have in previous Courses for the assignments, because they will take more time and because you will really enjoy them!\n\nCourse Four ends with an overview of methods for finalizing your pictures in print form, including simple but effective matting techniques, and in web page designs as well. The pleasures and perils of sharing in social media sites are also yours to discover. Protecting your copyrights by understanding that concept and the ways that you can assert them, being careful about blogs and other outlets, and recognizing you are part of a community that respects the individual's creative effort, well that is important knowledge to have in preparation for the Capstone too!

        "syllabus": "The Content of a Photograph\n-What are the broad areas of content that are most closely associated with photography? Why is photography well suited to image-making in these areas, and where do your interests synchronize with those of photographers past and present? You will gain a greater understanding of those and other questions, and knowledge of a range of typical pictures in a variety of categories too, in this set of lessons. Understanding these broad categories will help you to form your own projects, including the Capstone Project in Course 5, with confidence that you are part of a stream of tradition, building on a foundation that you as a photographer are a part of!\n\nLight Fundamentals 1.0: People, Places, Things under Ambient Light\n-In this Module you will begin with an overview of light itself, and learn to recognize the characteristics of typical \"ambient,\" aka continuous light natural to the environment. From photographing early in the morning, through midday to evening, in exterior and interior environments, you will learn to recognize typical light/subject situations and be able to use new tips and techniques on how to get the best results. People, places, and things each require nuanced approaches, even under similar lighting, and you will learn to recognize opportunities in each category.\n\nLight Fundamentals 2.0: People, Places, Things under Controlled Light\n-In this Module you will learn about essential light and exposure principles that are critical to your success in photography that is made with lights that you can control. From continuous-light to built-in-camera flash to auxiliary \"hotshoe\" strobes, you will establish a solid foundation of light and lighting principles and practices, especially related to the flash. With a built-in flash in most digital cameras, it is essential to have a full understanding of that important device. You will have much better control of the flash with the information you gain in this Module. Rounding out this module are lessons on practical photography activities that you will be able to apply to addressing your own individual needs for specialized picture situations, even with a Smart phone!\n\nFinishing Pictures: Options for Showing and Sharing\n-In this Module you will survey the ways that you can bring your digital images out of the world of zeros and ones that are stored in your computer, and bring them into the world through various means of sharing. Whether your interests are in producing prints of your photographs or quality web-based displays, you will have the knowledge to control their appearance through calibration that is essential for a professional presentation. You will also learn about the pitfalls and dangers of sharing in social media and other sites, and how to take precautions to protect yourself, your family and friends, and your photographs. You will also gain an understanding of standard options for dissemination of your photos in print form, on sharing sites, and even in your very own website.",

Connect with the course team and fellow learners on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/HKUxArchitecture\nThis 5-week introductory course is for those who would like to explore and be fascinated by vernacular architecture \u2013 the subject and study of everyday buildings, landscapes and sites which are not designed by professional architects but \u201cordinary\u201d practitioners. It explores vernacular architecture as an expression of local identity, indigenous traditions, and assimilation of different cultures.\nThis course covers topics such as native building materials, the interaction between people, culture and the vernacular, as well as the vernacular landscape. It has a special emphasis on the built heritage of Asia, which allows students to take a closer look at examples in diverse locales, such as the leather yurts in Mongolia, timber houses in Japan, brick, mud and straw houses in India, reinforced concrete fortified towers and grey brick courtyard houses in Southern China including Macau and Hong Kong.\nDesigned to promote discussion and dialogue while contributing to the discourse surrounding the concept of the vernacular, this course challenges the perception of tradition and stimulates a deeper analysis of one\u2019s local environment. Indeed, we are keen to hear about how you link your new understanding to vernacular architecture in your neighborhood.",

        "overview": "Did you ever wonder how music works?\n\nThis course provides free video, audio and journal resources that explain six basic principles about how music can influence individual and community health and wellbeing. From biology and neuroscience, to psychotherapy and politics, the ways we engage with music can make all the difference. Music has always played an integral role in the lives of individuals and communities all around the globe. This course explores the ways that music can be used to achieve positive changes with a particular emphasis on the most vulnerable persons. Six different understandings will be explored, each with their own set of values and assumptions. The greatest thinkers in each approach believe that their way of explaining the power of music is right, but we will show that understanding music in its entirety delivers the best results in each unique circumstance. Once we understand the various ways that music can change the world, we can make informed decisions about how best to employ its extraordinary power.\n\nLearners who engage in this MOOC can expect to both deepen and broaden their understanding of how music can be used with individuals, groups and communities. Specifically: \u2022 To distinguish between how music works on the body, in the brain, through the unconscious, for bonding, as political action and in reflecting culture, \u2022 To design practical programs that utilise music to support individuals, groups and communities based on examples shared in the \u2018on-site\u2019 case studies.\n\nView the MOOC promotional video here: http://tinyurl.com/jnde3w3",

        "syllabus": "How can music influence the body to support fitness and rehabilitation?\n-Music has been used throughout history and across cultures to influence the body, but only in recent decades have researchers been able to examine how it is processed through the brain. These recent discoveries explain the relationship between features of music like rhythm, and improvements in physical health, particularly in rehabilitation. They also explain why people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease remember all of the words to songs but can\u2019t have a clear conversation. In this unit we hear and see how music has been used, often by qualified music therapists working in hospitals, to influence the body and support fitness and rehabilitation.\n\nHow can music motivate the mind to promote academic achievement?\n-How much music is included in schools varies significantly, between countries and even around the corner. Learning music can happen in classrooms and through individual lessons. It can also be used to promote wellbeing and foster inclusion of diverse students. Researchers have investigated whether learning music results in higher achievement in other cognitive, social and psychological domains. In this unit we showcase some of that research and carefully consider what kinds of musical experiences are needed to achieve the different goals.\n\nHow can music reflect the psyche to improve mental health?\n-Music can be a powerful way to explore and comprehend our deepest emotions. When used in psychoanalysis, this can lead to rich experiences that may even reveal aspects of our unconscious world that can be processed within the safety of the therapeutic relationship. Within the field of music therapy, practitioners often debate the relative merits of free improvisation on instruments in comparison to using the preferred songs of clients in therapy. Both afford opportunities to deepen our understanding of ourselves and our relationships to others, and music more generally can be used as a health resource that travels with us as we recover from being acutely unwell and continue the journey of life.\n\nHow can music foster intimacy to strengthen relationships?\n-Have you ever used music to try and improve a relationship in your life? Playing the right background music is one thing, but what about singing with another person, or improvising on musical instruments in responsive and caring ways. Listening is the key to intimacy in any relationship and music can be the perfect vehicle to explore listening in new ways. We explore intimacy between parents and infants, therapists and clients and the ways that music therapists engage in musicking with people to build relationships that help.\n\nHow can music enhance connectedness to support communities?\n-Is the power of music strongest when used by groups and communities?\nMusic has often been used by groups of people to express their shared beliefs, but it can be just as powerful when we connect musically with people whose beliefs and backgrounds are different. When we sing in choirs and dance in groups, a sense of community can be fostered that transcends differences and highlights those things that we share. But music has also been used to encourage one group to fight against another group of people, so using music requires careful consideration of power and privilege to ensure that change is for the greater good.\n\nHow can music express culture and honour our diverse societies?\n-Each of us belongs to a range of culture and subcultures, including our ethnic heritage, our gender and sexuality, our abilities and ages. Many of us live in diverse neighbourhoods and cities where it is not enough to be culturally tolerant - we need to be culturally curious and engaged. Music is a powerful way of honouring diversity in culture and has been used to transcend differences and come together as many voices singing one song. We explore how important it is to be aware of our own power and privilege when musicking with people from cultures other than our own.\n\nCourse wrap-up\n-We finish up the course this week with some closing remarks and a final assignment for you to undertake. We've also included some bonus podcasts and an interview for those who are interested.",

        "description": "Did you ever wonder how music works? \n\nThis course provides free video, audio and journal resources that explain six basic principles about how music can influence individual and community health and wellbeing. From biology and neuroscience, to psychotherapy and politics, the ways we engage with music can make all the difference. Music has always played an integral role in the lives of individuals and communities all around the globe. This course explores the ways that music can be used to achieve positive changes with a particular emphasis on the most vulnerable persons. Six different understandings will be explored, each with their own set of values and assumptions. The greatest thinkers in each approach believe that their way of explaining the power of music is right, but we will show that understanding music in its entirety delivers the best results in each unique circumstance. Once we understand the various ways that music can change the world, we can make informed decisions about how best to employ its extraordinary power.\n\nLearners who engage in this MOOC can expect to both deepen and broaden their understanding of how music can be used with individuals, groups and communities. Specifically: \u2022 To distinguish between how music works on the body, in the brain, through the unconscious, for bonding, as political action and in reflecting culture, \u2022 To design practical programs that utilise music to support individuals, groups and communities based on examples shared in the \u2018on-site\u2019 case studies. \n\nView the MOOC promotional video here: http://tinyurl.com/jnde3w3",

        "overview": "Descripci\u00f3n del curso\nEl MOOC titulado \"Imprimiendo en 3D\" quiere acercar a los usuarios esta tecnolog\u00eda, en constante cambio, que est\u00e1 llamada a revolucionar el mundo productivo y las relaciones comerciales en un corto espacio de tiempo. La liberalizaci\u00f3n de algunas patentes y el descenso del coste de las impresoras est\u00e1n acercando la impresi\u00f3n 3D a casi todas las personas. Desde sus inicios en los a\u00f1os ochenta del siglo XX, la impresi\u00f3n 3D ha ido perfeccionando tanto la propia impresora como diversificando los materiales que pueden emplearse. Por esta raz\u00f3n, se propone este curso para conocer las herramientas b\u00e1sicas de este proceso aditivo de fabricaci\u00f3n de objetos desde un soporte digital (dibujos realizados con alg\u00fan software: Blender, SketchUp, etc.), animado con ejemplos para que los usuarios pueden llevarlos a cabo (piezas de drenes, etc.). Este curso se plantea como la primera aproximaci\u00f3n a este mundo de la impresi\u00f3n 3D con vistas a profundizar en posibles futuros MOOCs (\"Construcci\u00f3n de drones apoy\u00e1ndose en impresi\u00f3n 3D\", \"Dise\u00f1o avanzado con softwares para impresi\u00f3n en 3D\", etc.).",

        "overview": "This course aims to enhance your understanding and appreciation of Ludwig van Beethoven\u2019s music by exploring a genre at the very core of his development as a composer: the string quartet. Evenly distributed among the periods into which his life and work are customarily divided, his 16 quartets offer a broadly representative record of his changing musical language. The six quartets of the first period follow closely in the footsteps of Beethoven's teacher Haydn, the acknowledged \u201cfather\" of the genre; the five quartets of the middle period significantly expand musical form as well as the range of dramatic expression; the remaining five quartets, written in the composer's idiosyncratic \"late style,\" take the genre to unheard-of levels of innovation.\nTaught by music historian and Stanford Professor Stephen Hinton in collaboration with the university's ensemble-in-residence, the St. Lawrence String Quartet, you\u2019ll be given a critical overview of Beethoven\u2019s quartets and their reception history. Using a mix of lectures, discussions and copious demonstrations, Professor Hinton will focus in detail on three complete quartets: one early, one middle, and one late. As a special course feature, you\u2019ll view live performances by the SLSQ recorded in Stanford's Bing Concert Hall.\nYou will learn:",

The purpose of this course is to introduce the basic concepts of modern improvisation and how to go about mastering the different musical and mental skills involved.\n\nCourse author Gary Burton codifies a sought-after approach to improvisation that has been at the core of Berklee College of Music's curriculum for decades. Students who complete this course will know what to practice and how to practice the various aspects of improvising, in addition to understanding how the improviser spontaneously communicates to the listeners through their musical creations.",

        "syllabus": "Welcome to Jazz Improvisation\n-Welcome to the course! Here we will cover all the details about the course and what you'll need to know to get the most out of your experience.\n\nImprovisation as a Language\n-Since everybody who is taking this course starts from a different place in terms of their experience as an improviser, it's important at first to cover some basic material. We'll begin our journey by exploring the language used by jazz improvisors. Improvisation is analogous to language in many ways. With music, we become fluent when the vocabulary (scales and chords) and grammar (harmonic progressions) are assimilated into conversational content or story (melodic themes and structure) and we no longer have to consciously think about them while we play.\n\nThe Improviser's Vocabulary\n-In this lesson, we'll explore the improviser's lingo. We'll identify the most common chord scales and the type of harmony they relate to including major, minor, and dominant 7.\n\nMaking Scale Choices in Real Time\n-Improvisers must be able to quickly recall chord scales and be able to play around on them fluently. This becomes important when choosing which chord scale to use on a given harmony\u2014another thing we must be able to determine immediately. When a new tune is put in front of you at a session or a rehearsal, there isn't time to take the music home and spend an hour or two working out the correct scales. Improvisers need a quick, mostly intuitive way of making these scale choices in real time as the tune is being played. This week, we'll explore my method for making these quick musical decisions.\n\nHarmony for Improvisers\n-It is important for an improviser to clearly imply the harmonies when improvising. It is not enough to just play correct notes on each chord. In this lesson we'll examine how the improviser helps the harmonies move. Part of the improviser's job is to help the listener follow the changes as the chords move from one to another.\n\nTheme and Variation\n-This week we will discuss how the improviser develops melodic themes in a solo. As mentioned in week 1, there are natural comparisons between speech and improvising that illustrate how this functions. The most common technique for telling a musical story that engages the listener for the duration of your solo is by using a traditional concept called theme and variation. That is, you introduce a theme\u2014a musical phrase\u2014then repeat it, making variations on it to develop an interesting storyline. A good solo is like an explanation, or a good story. The explanation or story is the content of improvisation.",

        "description": "Learn the basic concepts of improvisation from Gary Burton, one of the most renowned improvisers in the jazz world, including the mental, melodic, and harmonic processes that contribute to the instinctive skills that an improviser puts to use when taking a solo.\n\nWhile many people are fans of jazz and understand that musicians are often \u201cmaking up\u201d the notes they are playing during a performance, most people\u2014often including musicians, themselves, who are beginning to learn improvising\u2014aren\u2019t clear about what exact processes take place to enable this to happen. The purpose of this course is to introduce the basic concepts of modern improvisation and how to go about mastering the different musical and mental skills involved. \n\nCourse author Gary Burton codifies a sought-after approach to improvisation that has been at the core of Berklee College of Music&#039;s curriculum for decades. Students who complete this course will know what to practice and how to practice the various aspects of improvising, in addition to understanding how the improviser spontaneously communicates to the listeners through their musical creations.",

Tanto los instrumentos musicales como las obras se muestran atravesados por el pensamiento y la tecnolog\u00eda de las \u00e9pocas en que son concebidos. Por ello, el desarrollo del arte sonoro, una disciplina en principio bien diferenciada de la m\u00fasica, es deudor de los logros tecnol\u00f3gicos concebidos y realizados para ella. Sin embargo, como el campo de acci\u00f3n del arte sonoro es m\u00e1s amplio que el de aquella, sus creaciones tambi\u00e9n se han visto afectadas por la aparici\u00f3n, as\u00ed como la democratizaci\u00f3n de tecnolog\u00edas de muy diversa especie, entre las que cabe contar todas las relacionadas con las redes sociales. M\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n en http://www.ub.edu/artsonoronline/ y http://www.ub.edu/masterartsonor/es\n\nESCULTURA SONORA\n-Desde una perspectiva general, llegamos a centramos en la obra de los hermanos Fran\u00e7ois y Bernard Baschet, pioneros de la investigaci\u00f3n en ac\u00fastica aplicada. Desarrollaron un m\u00e9todo intuitivo y emp\u00edrico para comprender los elementos funcionales de cualquier objeto sonoro -existente o por inventar- que rigen las relaciones entre las formas, los materiales y las acciones, con respecto de los atributos de sus sonidos. Su sistema permite continuar explorando nuevas configuraciones, sonoridades e interfaces para usos especializados o como interactivos sugerentes para todo tipo de personas. M\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n en http://www.ub.edu/artsonoronline/ y http://www.ub.edu/masterartsonor/es\n\nPAISAJE SONORO\n-Como todos los t\u00e9rminos atractivos, el de Paisaje Sonoro, ha experimentado una evoluci\u00f3n desde que fue enunciado por primera vez. En el M\u00e1ster en Arte Sonoro de la UB, lo concebimos como la percepci\u00f3n y la comprensi\u00f3n, as\u00ed como la integraci\u00f3n cognitiva de un entorno sonoro por alg\u00fan individuo o grupo social de tama\u00f1o y alcance arbitrario. Se trata de una idea muy bien diseminada entra la comunidad art\u00edstica. Aqu\u00ed vemos algunas consideraciones est\u00e9ticas b\u00e1sicas, junto a una serie de conceptos que han sido empleados tanto por la comunidad cient\u00edfica como art\u00edstica.\n\nM\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n en http://www.ub.edu/artsonoronline/ y http://www.ub.edu/masterartsonor/es\n\nPSICOAC\u00daSTICA Y M\u00daSICA EXPERIMENTAL\n-El estudio de la m\u00fasica tiene mucho que ofrecer a la comprensi\u00f3n de la mente humana. El punto de partida de los psic\u00f3logos de la m\u00fasica es que la estructura y el proceso musical puede dar pistas acerca de la naturaleza de las estructuras mentales y sus procesos. Por su parte, la psicoac\u00fastica, cuyo objetivo es la comprensi\u00f3n de las bases de la audici\u00f3n, ofrece claves importantes para la comprensi\u00f3n de los hechos musicales. Adem\u00e1s de estas cuestiones de importancia para el pensamiento art\u00edstico del sonido y de la m\u00fasica, este m\u00f3dulo introduce a la idea de experimentaci\u00f3n en m\u00fasica, as\u00ed como su historia. De hecho, los m\u00fasicos de todas las \u00e9pocas siempre experimentaron, pero no es hasta mediados del siglo XX que el concepto aparece, en parte, de la necesidad estrat\u00e9gica del Groupe de Recherches de Musique Concr\u00e8te, cuya sede se estableci\u00f3 en la Radiodifussion Television Fran\u00e7aise para diferenciarse de la corriente creada en el Studio f\u00fcr elektronische Musik des Westdeutschen Rundfunks de Colonia. Como todos los conceptos ricos en asociaciones, el de \u201cm\u00fasica experimental\u201d fue r\u00e1pidamente adoptado por gran n\u00famero de m\u00fasicos y evolucion\u00f3 r\u00e1pidamente, de manera que, en la actualidad, es un t\u00e9rmino polis\u00e9mico. M\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n en http://www.ub.edu/artsonoronline/ y http://www.ub.edu/masterartsonor/es\n\nPERFORMANCE, ACCI\u00d3N SONORA Y POES\u00cdA SONORA\n-La poes\u00eda sonora es quiz\u00e1 una de las pr\u00e1cticas m\u00e1s transversales y creativas del arte sonoro. Desde las vanguardias hasta la actual Polipoes\u00eda, los enamorados del texto y de la voz nos han mostrado caminos llenos de piedras preciosas. La acci\u00f3n sonora es un g\u00e9nero que procede tanto de las artes pl\u00e1sticas, como de la m\u00fasica y de las otras artes de la escena. De hecho, en cierta manera, algunas formas de concierto o intervenci\u00f3n teatral podr\u00edan ser vistas como acci\u00f3n sonora. Contrariamente a otras manifestaciones del arte sonoro, se presenta \"en vivo\" y forma parte de un g\u00e9nero m\u00e1s amplio, el arte de acci\u00f3n, tambi\u00e9n denominado, acci\u00f3n y \u201cperformance\u201d, que ha desempe\u00f1ado un papel en el arte de vanguardia a lo largo de todo siglo XX, desde el Futurismo y el Dad\u00e1.

        "overview": "The course, lecture, and examples build on each other to teach the fundamentals of programming in general (logic, loops, functions, objects, classes) and also deals with advanced topics including multi-threading, events and signals.  Throughout the course, students create meaningful and rewarding expressive digital \u201cinstruments\u201d that make sound and music in direct response to program logic.  The ChucK language provides precise high-level control over time, audio computation, and user interface elements (track pad, joysticks, etc.).  ChucK is used (unknowingly in most cases, via SMule Apps) by millions of users throughout the world, and is the backbone of dozens of academic programs and laptop orchestras.  Learning to program using ChucK, through the musical examples provided in this course, will prepare students to program in C++, Java, and other languages. There will be special guest lectures from creators of the ChucK language, Dr. Ge Wang (Stanford University) and Dr. Perry R. Cook (Princeton University).",

        "syllabus": "An Introduction to the Beauty of Kunqu Opera\n-Welcome to The Beauty of Kunqu Opera! The following lecture videos will give you some ideas of the historical background and characteristics of Kunqu, China\u2019s classical opera that originated more than 600 years ago and blossomed during the late Ming and early Qing dynasties (around 16th \u2013 17th centuries). The introduction is followed by excerpts and analysis of The Peony Pavilion, Kunqu\u2019s masterpiece. The poetic artistry shown in the arias, dialogues and dance movement of the characters exemplifies the aesthetic achievement of Kunqu.\n\nThe Beauty of Kunqu Music\n-Kunqu means music/song (qu) that originated from the district of Kunshan, Jiangsu province. The word itself shows the fundamental role played by music in this Chinese classical opera. This week, Prof. Lindy Li Mark from the California State University, East Bay will talk about the musical aspect of Kunqu. What are the musical features of Kunqu melodies? What is tune-type and what does a traditional score of Kunqu look like? How is the music of Kunqu different from that of the Western operas? What instruments are used in a Kunqu ensemble? Answers to these questions can be found in the lecture videos.\n\nThe Art of Kunqu Performance: the Male Role-Types\n-Just like other genres of Chinese opera, Kunqu has a broad range of role-types, such as male (sheng), female (dan), painted face (jing) and comic (chou). From this week on, legendary performing artists who have devoted their whole lives to Kunqu will talk about the role-types they specialize in and their facial makeup, costume, singing, speaking and movements. In addition, they will demonstrate some of the very important repertoires in Kunqu and share with us the characteristics of each of them.\nThis week, Maestros Yue Meiti and Cai Zhengren will talk about one of the most important role-types of Kunqu, the male role-type. Classical plays such as The Jade Hairpin, The Shepherd, and The Palace of Eternal Life will be introduced as well.\n\nThe Art of Kunqu Performance: the Female Role-Type\n-The female role-type is another prominent role-type of Kunqu and can be divided into a number of subtypes. In this week lively lectures and demonstration by Maestros Zhang Jingxian (mature female), Zhang Jiqing (young noble lady), Liang Guyin (vivacious young female) and Wang Zhiquan (martial female) will show us the charisma of the diversified female characters on the Kunqu stage from Chinese classics such as The Lute, The Peony Pavilion and Journey to the West.\n\nThe Art of Kunqu Performance: Integration of the Painted Face and Warrior Role-Types\n-The colorful and complex facial makeup of the painted face role-type is probably the most noticeable feature in the eyes of the audience. But what does facial makeup mean and how is it done? This week, Maestro Hou Shaokui will unfold the mysteries for us. He will also share with us his portrayal of Lord Guan, a well-known household character based on the most famous Chinese historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms. What is more, this unique character combines the essence of both the painted face and warrior role-types.\n\nThe Art of Kunqu Performance: the Comic Role-Type\n-When appreciating the well written script and the beautiful melody of Kunqu, sometimes audiences just want a good laugh in the theatre. This cannot be done without the contribution of the comic role-type. This week, Maestro Zhang Mingrong will explain the characteristics of the different subtypes of the comic role-type, namely young chou, fu chou and martial/acrobatic chou. From Maestro Zhang\u2019s demonstration we will also see that mastering the comic role-type requires much more skill than just natural talent.\n\nThe New Aesthetics of Kunqu: Tradition and Modernity\n-Drawing examples from the production of The Peony Pavilion (Young Lover\u2019s Edition) and The Jade Hairpin (New Edition), Prof. Kenneth Hsien-yung Pai will illustrate how Kunqu today can attract the younger generation by adding modern elements in stagecraft while preserving the basic aesthetics of Kunqu.",

        "overview": "This dynamic course focuses on the history of modern and postmodern art from the 19th and 20th centuries, with an emphasis on major works found in the collection of the renowned Art Institute of Chicago.  Painting, sculpture, photography, and other media, placed within a larger socio-political context, will reveal how aesthetic expression proves a compelling barometer of the modern human experience. \nFrom the advent of European democracy and the parallel birth of the avant-garde artist, whose singular vision boldly shattered prevailing styles and norms, to the radical rise of abstract painting and the even more provocative introduction of everyday objects into works of art, this course will unfold modernism\u2019s defiant embrace of the new. This course will engage the major issues of twentieth-century aesthetic practice, from Freud\u2019s description of the unconscious and the play of dreams as fertile source material for the artist, to the explosive rise of pop art and the dizzying information age that has profoundly shaped contemporary practice. To closely study modern and postmodern art is to learn how to look at the world, to take notice of form, color, and image, and to respond to the richness of visual and material culture that is all around us. \nThis course will not only provide a canonical repertoire of great works of historic art, as well as the context for understanding them, but through the unfolding of such a narrative, these lectures will allow new ways of observing one\u2019s own contemporary world and reimagining its value.",

This course will engage the major issues of twentieth-century aesthetic practice,&amp;nbsp;from Freud&amp;rsquo;s description of the unconscious and the play of dreams as fertile source material for the artist, to the explosive rise of pop art and the dizzying information age that has profoundly shaped contemporary practice.&amp;nbsp;To closely study modern and postmodern art is to learn how to look at the world, to take notice of form, color, and image, and to respond to the richness of visual and material culture that is all around us.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This course will not only provide a canonical repertoire of great works of historic art, as well as the context for understanding them, but through the unfolding of such a narrative, these lectures will allow new ways of observing one&amp;rsquo;s own contemporary world and reimagining its value.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

        "syllabus": "Tiepolo\u2019s Cleopatra\n-We begin this MOOC by introducing you to some of the theories about gender and sexuality that we will be calling upon throughout this course. We will look at the tradition of the representation of women in art and the operation of the 'male gaze', which renders most female subjects passive in pictures. We will focus, in this unit, on an unusual exception to this tradition, Tiepolo's Banquet of Cleopatra at the National Gallery of Victoria, in which we see Cleopatra depicted as a powerful regent. How does Tiepolo break the rules in this painting, emphasising Cleopatra\u2019s agency? How did Tiepolo\u2019s facility with paint work to produce this gendered narrative? And who exactly was Cleopatra?\n\nThe Culture of Sensibility and the \u2018Man of Feeling\u2019\n-This week we examine in detail Thomas Gainsborough\u2019s much loved Portrait of an officer of the Fourth Regiment of Foot, the portrait of Richard St George Mansergh-St George in the collection of the National Gallery of Victoria. Here we consider how Gainsborough produced his portrait of the young soldier through the ideals associated with the culture of sensibility, so much a part of late eighteenth century ruling class culture. How is the concept of the \u2018man of feeling\u2019 utilised in Gainsborough\u2019s enigmatic portrait? What is the relevance of Gainsborough\u2019s focus upon the soldier\u2019s hound? What does the picture tell us about masculinity and the way the culture of sensibility was gendered in eighteenth century Britain?\n\nGainsborough at the Huntington\n-We consider five pictures by Thomas Gainsborough in week three of this course that are held in the collection of the Huntington Gallery in California, through an explication of how the artist represented his subjects in the context of the culture of sensibility. Beginning with Gainsborough\u2019s painting of Karl Friedrich Abel, we consider how the artist produced his portrait of masculinity through references to music, science and the senses. We then move to Gainsborough\u2019s pendant portraits of Lord and Lady Ligonier, and The Blue Boy, focussing upon boundaries of gender and sexuality, including debates around effeminacy and passion between the sexes. We conclude with the Huntington\u2019s Cottage Door, considering how this staged scene calls the viewer to look with charity upon impoverished rural women and their children.\n\nSexual Codes in Eighteenth Century French Courtly Painting\n-This week Jennifer Milam, Professor of Art History at the University of Sydney, reveals the sexual codes and symbols of art in eighteenth century French painting. Professor Milam uncovers the erotic references imbedded in the courtly art of Fran\u00e7ois Boucher and Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard. Two pastoral paintings by Fran\u00e7ois Boucher form the centrepiece of this discussion of the playful and provocative representation of gender in the Ancien R\u00e9gime. In addition, Professor Milam provides an in depth account of how these codes operated in some famous prints and drawings of the period.\n\nOrientalism, Gender and Display - Painting in Morocco\n-This week Dr Caroline Wallace and I present a study of two artists working in Morocco in the early twentieth century; the British Royal Academy painter John Lavery and the Australian modernist Hilda Rix Nicholas. They examine how these artists used orientalist conventions to represent a European point of view of life in Morocco. In this unit we consider how colonialism, orientalism and gender relate to each other, impacting upon academic and modernist art in a variety of ways that are not immediately apparent. We discuss how orientalist art is gendered, investigating why Rix Nicholas\u2019 practice has been described as counter-orientalist.\n\nHenri Rousseau: Challenging the Myth of the Passive Woman\n-This week Professor Barbara Creed explores the way Henri Rousseau challenged the myth of the passive woman and relocates women as a vital source of creativity and mystery in art. In The Dream woman is represented as the new Eve living in harmony with nature in a jungle paradise, while in The Sleeping Gypsy woman is on an inner journey into the realms of the unconscious. Professor Creed explores the spiritual dimensions of this painting and offers a new and exciting interpretation of its historical significance.\n\nHenri Matisse, Paul Cezanne and Max Dupain - Modernism, Gender and the Science of Movement\n-Scientific advances in the nineteenth and early twentieth century created new ideas about male and female bodies. In a unique reading of Henri Matisse's Dance and Paul Cezanne's The Bather, we consider how Darwinian theory and science impacted upon the work of these French modernists and how modernism itself undercut erotic codes in art. Dr Isobel Crombie, Senior Curator of Photography at the National Gallery of Victoria, interprets the representation of gender in the work of the Australian photographer Max Dupain as an expression of the twentieth century movement of vitalism.\n\nFrida Kahlo, Glyn Philpot and the Struggle to Paint\n-This week we begin by looking at Frida Kahlo\u2019s Fulang-Chang and I as well as her Self-Portrait with Cropped Hair Canvas. These lectures on Frida Kahlo's pictures at MOMA finish with a discussion between myself and Redmond Barry Distinguished Professor Barbara Creed in which we consider WJT Mitchell 's famous question 'what do pictures want? This is followed by a video on Glyn Philpot\u2019s Oedipus presented by Dr Ted Gott, Senior Curator of International Art at the National Gallery of Victoria.\n\nWhat is Women\u2019s Business? Indigenous Art and the Dreaming\n-National Gallery of Victoria Senior Curator of Indigenous Art, Judith Ryan, takes us deep into the Dreaming of the Australian Indigenous tradition. She examines in detail the making of two masterpieces by women artists from the Australian outback; Emily Kam Kngwarray's Big Yam Dreaming and Martumili artists\u2019 Ngayartu Kujarra. In this unit we look at these iconic works in the context of \u2018women's business\u2019 and the gendered stories of indigenous Australia.",

        "overview": "Design professionals, supervisors and managers are required to understand, use, and extract value from digital manufacturing. Industrial design is a world that has grown increasingly digital, and in which the duration from idea to implementation is shorter than it has ever been.\nThis course gives you an opportunity to connect to emerging trends and technologies, the instructors, and their insights. It is taught by TU Delft's leading scholars and experts in digital manufacturing. The Industrial Design Engineering faculty at TU Delft is a world leader in the application of technology, especially in applying it in a human-centered way. It is known for setting the agenda for the creative industry.\nThere are three major steps in the digital manufacturing workflow that we cover in depth. These include: scanning, modelling, and fabrication. We also consider how each step could be applied within your business, and the value that each can offer.\nIn this course we will explore primary additive manufacturing technologies, of which some can be considered as 3D printing. Those include: material extrusion, powder bed fusion, material jetting, binder jetting, sheet lamination, photopolymerization, and directed energy deposition. We consider their advantages, logistical challenges, and the workflow required to get the most out of this palette of techniques.",

In 8000901-1X, History of Chinese Architecture: Part 1, we know the development of Chinese architecture from the remote antiquity to the Song, Liao and Jin dynasty. In Part 2 we\u2019ll go on looking at Chinese architecture of the Yuan, Ming and Qing period. We\u2019ll explore the city of Dadu of Yuan and Beijing of Ming and Qing, and delve into the history of the awe-inspiring ancient buildings that still grace the landscape of these bustling cities. The course will cover construction and aesthetics of these imperial palaces, religious structures, pagodas, tombs and gardens. The course will culminate in an examination of the Summer Palace in Beijing, the ancient royal garden at the Chengde Mountain Resort, and the private gardens of the Ming and Qing dynasties.

This course covers the music of Led Zeppelin, the Allman Brothers, Carole King, Bob Marley, the Sex Pistols, Donna Summer, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Prince, Metallica, Run-DMC, and Nirvana, and many more artists, with an emphasis both on cultural context and on the music itself. We will also explore how developments in the music business and in technology helped shape the ways in which styles developed.\n\nEmerging out of the experimental and ambitious years of late-60s psychedelia, rock splintered into a variety of styles in the 1970s as the music business continued to expand. By the end of the decade, punk and disco had challenged the excesses of the hippie aesthetic, as rock became more commercially streamlined and radio friendly. The emergence and rise of MTV transformed pop music and propelled the careers of Michael jackson and Madonna, while heavy metal and hip hop dominated the late 1980s.

Aunque este MOOC ya se realiz\u00f3, si te inscribes podr\u00e1s acceder a los contenidos m\u00e1s importantes y a los v\u00eddeos. Sin embargo, no podr\u00e1s realizar ninguna de las actividades ni te podr\u00e1s certificar. Cuando est\u00e9 disponible una nueva edici\u00f3n podr\u00e1s inscribirte para que obtengas la experiencia completa de un MOOC de Mir\u00edadax.\n\nSeg\u00fan la Uni\u00f3n Europea, la industria de los drones se har\u00e1 con el 10% del mercado aeron\u00e1utico en la d\u00e9cada 2016-2026. Esto supondr\u00e1 unos 15,000 millones de euros anuales. El valor de mercado de los UAV (veh\u00edculo a\u00e9reo no tripulado) o drones de uso civil, a nivel mundial, se cifr\u00f3 en torno a los 500 millones de d\u00f3lares en 2014. Est\u00e1 previsto que esta cifra incremente hasta los 2,00 millones de d\u00f3lares en 2018. Otras fuentes estiman que el valor de los UAV peque\u00f1os (con peso inferior a 20kg) sobrepasar\u00e1 los 8,400 millones de d\u00f3lares en 2019, en el que el uso comercial de esta tecnolog\u00eda dominar\u00eda el mercado. De los 84,400 millones de d\u00f3lares, unos 5,1 corresponder\u00edan a drones de uso civil. En definitiva, el auge del uso de drones para uso civil se une la innovaci\u00f3n que viene asociada a la impresi\u00f3n 3D. Este nuevo m\u00e9todo de producci\u00f3n de objetos ha dejado de ser un paradigma para convertirse en una realidad.

In the first peer review assignment you'll create your own series of images, experimenting with formal techniques. Later, you'll have the opportunity to rework those images to enhance their ability to communicate an idea through connotation in an optional assignment: give it a try, it'll help you develop your communication skills as well as your formal skills!\n\nWeek 2: Fundamentals of Typography\n-This week we are going to look at typographic terminology and the basic rules for creating typography. I'll show you a range of tips and techniques for working with type, in both a functional and expressive manner, and you'll find out about the process involved in making and controlling typography. This week you'll complete a quiz to make sure you understand the language of typography\u2013this is required. I also highly recommend you complete the two optional peer review assignments. In the first assignment you'll create your own typographic monogram, and you'll use that as a central element in designing a typographic business card in the second assignment. Give them a try, they are the place where you can demonstrate and apply your formal skills, and the place where you get to play with type!\n\nWeek 3: Fundamentals of Shape and Color\n-This week we are going to look at how designers work with shape and color as their fundamental building blocks. You'll learn about visual contrast, color, rhythm and pattern in design. I'll be showing you the process involved in making an abstract design from shapes, and how to use that element to create a repeating pattern design. You'll be completing a quiz (required!) to make sure you understand how visual contrast and color work, and I also highly recommend you complete the two optional peer review assignments. In the first assignment you'll create your own simple and complex design motifs, and you'll use them as the central elements in designing a repeating pattern in the second assignment. The assignments are optional, but they are the place where you get to demonstrate and apply your formal skills, so well worth taking the extra time to complete!\n\nWeek 4: Fundamentals of Composition\n-This week we are going to look at how designers work with visual contrasts, cropping, hierarchy and direction in single images and complex compositions. You'll find out how to control and use scale, weight, direction, texture, and space in a composition, and how to compose work that ranges from the complex to the minimal. In the first peer review assignment you'll create your own abstract compositions that demonstrate your knowledge and control of visual contrast. In the final optional assignment, you can use all your skills from the entire course to create experimental compositions in the form of a poster for a mythical band. This last project is optional, but I strongly suggest you try it out, it'll let you grow and apply your design knowledge and really enjoy and express yourself in your design work!",

It is geared towards performers, artists, composers and creative producers interested in learning techniques and production practices for site-specific work. The course is open to both veterans of the field as well as emerging artists jumping in to the topic for the first time.\n\nSite-specific dance/performance is work created in response to a particular place or site, inspired by its architecture or design, its history, and/or its current use. Lectures and forum discussions will investigate site-based projects in both urban and non-urban locales, and ranging from large-scale to small (guerrilla) style productions. Furthermore, together we will delineate definitions of site-specificity, and look across the history of the field, focusing primarily on dance.\n\nSpecific techniques and approaches towards generating site-inspired choreography will be introduced here, but the primary focus is navigating technical issues (lighting, sound, media) and production challenges (budgeting, obtaining permissions, insurance, fundraising, audience/event design).

        "syllabus": "Week 1: History and Context\nWhat is site-specific performance and dance? Through a number of examples, we'll define the genre through four distinct categories, and survey the range of site work in dance, performance, and installation-based practices.\n\nWeek 2: Working from the Outside In\nThis week\u2019s lectures are about dealing with the many pre-production decisions that go into creating a site-specific piece. We\u2019ll look at what can influence an artist\u2019s decisions when selecting a site and cover how to assess a site from the \"outside\" before making decisions about the content of a potential performance (the \u201cinside\u201d of a site). Finally, we\u2019ll cover how to put together a working budget.\n\nWeek 3: Research & Staging\nThis week, we will cover how to begin developing an artistic proposal for a site through a variety of set research \"filters\". In the last lecture, we will revisit the locations of several previous performances by students in the Sharon Disney Lund School of Dance at CalArts (as well as one of his own!) to demonstrate how to perform a site inventory.\n\n\nThis module will cover methods of generating content as it applies to site and the concept for your work. We will look at production and collaborative issues around sound/music, lighting, costumes and media.\n\n\nA myriad of challenges may arise when creating site-specific work, so it helps to be prepared. We\u2019ll take a look at safety issues, and what you might need to consider when making site work for urban and natural environments. We\u2019ll also talk about working with different production staff (costume, lighting, and sound designers) and other creative collaborators.\n\n\nIn a continuation of last week's ideas of making the work a reality, we'll delve into fundraising and marketing strategies to get your performance off the ground. We will also look at different options for documenting your work with video and still photography.\n\n\nLooking for where to explore next? This module includes extended interviews with three of the featured artists from this course, case studies in site-specific work, and resources from the class for reference. This module also includes a Directory with links to site-specific works, artists, and more!",

The emphasis is on mastering tangible artistic concepts; the gear you use is up to you. You will learn to develop the most important tool in the recording studio: your ears. You will learn to enhance every aspect of your own productions, both sonically and musically, by employing deeper listening skills.\n\nAssignments will include posting your own recordings for peer review, and reviewing your classmates\u2019 work by employing specific tools and strategies. If you use a digital audio workstation to record and mix, that\u2019s great, but as long as you can record into your computer and post an MP3, you can complete the assignments.\n\nAs you learn about the art of record production in this 4-week course, you will also learn about yourself and who you are as an artist and producer.

You\u2019ll train yourself to make distinctions on what works and what doesn\u2019t work, rather than just passively listening as a fan.\n\nIdentity, Vision, and Intention\n-In this lesson, you\u2019ll hone in on your identity as a recording artist: who are you, and what are you meaning to convey through your music? You\u2019ll work on refining your vision and intention for the recordings you\u2019ll make employing these skills, and record and post a \u201cwork tape\u201d of a new piece of music.\n\nStrengthening Musical Productions: Tools & Strategies\n-By the end of this lesson, you will be able to employ several useful techniques for strengthening your songs and instrumental tracks. You\u2019ll acquire skills in prosody, focus, and an intelligent approach to repetition. You\u2019ll also learn to craft better melodies, write better lyrics, and construct a musical form that best suits the emotional contour you are trying to accomplish with your recording. You\u2019ll understand the principles of getting the most out of feedback on your recordings, in order to gather valuable perspective to better convey your intended response. You\u2019ll incorporate notes from your colleagues to further refine your recording and re-post an updated version.\n\nDefining the Sonic Signature of your Song\n-By the end of this lesson, you will address the sonic signature as it relates to your intention and vision, as well as your technology resources and acoustic space. You\u2019ll learn about microphone techniques, getting good levels, and mixing with reverb, EQ and compression. You will record your material, having made some deliberate decisions about the sound of your record, and post your recording for peer review according to specific criteria.",

        "description": "Explore the art of record production and how to make recordings that other people will love listening to. This course will teach you how to make emotionally moving recordings on almost any recording equipment, including your phone or laptop. The emphasis is on mastering tangible artistic concepts; the gear you use is up to you. You will learn to develop the most important tool in the recording studio: your ears. You will learn to enhance every aspect of your own productions, both sonically and musically, by employing deeper listening skills. \n\nAssignments will include posting your own recordings for peer review, and reviewing your classmates\u2019 work by employing specific tools and strategies. If you use a digital audio workstation to record and mix, that\u2019s great, but as long as you can record into your computer and post an MP3, you can complete the assignments. \n\nAs you learn about the art of record production in this 4-week course, you will also learn about yourself and who you are as an artist and producer. It is not necessary that you read music or play an instrument to take this course.",

It\u2019s ideal if you can already play the piano and scales, and have a basic ability to read music.\nYou will learn more about the blues and jazz standards, and explore the nature of improvisation in more depth.\nYou will learn the basics by watching an overhead video of the keyboard, so you can try for yourself at home and you will also be able to play along to pre-recorded bass and drum tracks.\nThis course is ideal for any interested pianist, but may be of particular interest to university or college piano students studying music.\nWe recommend you complete the previous course Learn Jazz Piano: I. Begin with the Blues before you begin this one.\nYou\u2019ll need to have access to a piano or keyboard, and have a computer, tablet or smart phone set up next to it.",

To do this, we will start right away closely examining some actual, real music. First we will look at some Gregorian Chant (which, come on, can be stunningly beautiful). Second we will use some slow classic Jazz to thoughtfully build our vocabulary.\n\nMelodic Structures: Simplicity, Repetition, and Change\n-In this module, still looking at single melodic lines, we will start to branch farther afield to describe some useful technical descriptions of the differences between different simple and complicated musical styles.\n\nCombining Pitches: Consonance and Dissonance\n-Now we will start to describe different ways to think about playing pitches simultaneously. Carefully considering our terms, we will listen to a wide spectrum of styles before settling in to focus on the basics of common practice rules.\n\nCadences and Basic Harmonic Function\n-Beginning with a fuller examination of cadences, we will come up with ways to describe chords and harmonic function that help us talk and think about different styles of music. Finally, we will consider how our newly constructed vocabulary can help us describe the function and aesthetics of more and more complete pieces of music.",

We plug-in our guitars to a stomp box and guitar amp, or use a MIDI keyboard to play some synth parts and record a vocal line with a microphone into an audio interface on our laptop. Or some of us have the privilege of working on an 80-fader mixing console. This is all enabled by hardware engineers. From the analog circuit design, to the power amplifiers, designing customer chips, industrial design, manufacturing millions of units, and wireless synchronization. In audio and music, their work makes music more visceral - creative, tactile, and sounding amazing.\nSession 2: Marketing\nThe world's greatest product do not sell themselves - and I\u2019ve seen firsthand how product launches can make or break years of R&D. Marketing is about connecting to the customer - identifying who they are, what their needs and motivations are, how and where to deliver them, how to price them, and how to promote the products. Why should they care about your product? How do you keep them engaged in your community, happy with your product, and purchasing future products?\nSession 3: Research & Development\nThis session explores the teams and technology behind leading algorithms and advanced technologies. We look at how the R&D is developed, prioritized, and implemented - and the technical and interpersonal skills these engineers use to succeed. We\u2019ll look at Pandora\u2019s music recommendation algorithm, audio signal processing algorithms from iZotope, and the audio fingerprinting algorithms that allow our mobile devices to recognize songs in 3 seconds or less! We\u2019ll talk about how the R&D engineers might often get a lot of the credit, but the core algorithm might only be 5% of the total work developed!",

Vamos ver por que os acordes soam como eles soam, como constru\u00ed-los, como tocar facilmente acordes em posi\u00e7\u00e3o aberta, e como tocar acordes por todo o bra\u00e7o do instrumento.\n\nJUNTANDO TUDO: A ESCALA PENTAT\u00d4NICA E M\u00daSICAS\n-Agora que voc\u00ea tem a \u201cci\u00eancia\u201d da guitarra nas m\u00e3os, voc\u00ea aprender\u00e1 algumas m\u00fasicas. Voc\u00ea far\u00e1 isso usando a melodia (das escalas) e a harmonia (dos acordes) que aprendemos. Voc\u00ea tamb\u00e9m aprender\u00e1 uma escala essencial para tocar melodias e fazer solos",

Here we will cover all the details about the course and what you'll need to know to get the most out of your course experience.\n\nLesson 1\n-This week, we will explore the key of Eb Major and B minor. We will also learn about chord tensions and harmonic function, or, in other words, how chords function within a tonal center. We will continue to develop our ears by aurally identifying chord progressions and chord qualities.\n\nLesson 2\n-This week, we will explore learn a new chord progression, the I II- V I. If you took Developing Your Musicianship, you may remember the VII-7b5, but this week, we'll learn about diminished chords. We'll also continue to train our ears to hear chord progressions and qualities.\n\nLesson 3\n-This week, we will explore the concept of modal interchange, or borrowing chords from a parallel tonality. We'll also learn a new chord progression that showcases modal interchange, the bVI bVII I progression. Finally, we will continue to train our ears to hear chord progressions and qualities.\n\nLesson 4\n-This last lesson will focus on preparing you for your final course project: writing and performing a 16-bar song. We will run through a brief overview of the concepts you have learned over the past few weeks that you will be able to apply when you complete your project. We will also learn about suspended chords and we will continue our ear training practice.",

But perhaps the most obvious (and often overlooked) quality required of all sound engineers is the ability to listen.\nSound engineers must constantly evaluate the sound quality of individual sound sources in a mix and evaluate how these sound sources interrelate with one another. The ability to listen critically and make these judgements is a skill that must be learnt through trial and error and repeated practice. This free online course aims to provide you with tools for developing and refining the critical listening skills relevant to contemporary sound engineering and will be of interest to musicians, sound enthusiasts and experienced sound engineers alike.\nThe course begins by examining the nature of sound and how properties of sound (frequency, amplitude and sound intensity, for example) are expressed. The relationship between these physical properties and the more subjective characteristics of music such as pitch, loudness, dynamic range and timbre is then examined. The remainder of the course focuses on the signal processing techniques commonly used by sound engineers when mixing multitrack recordings - for example, equalisation, compression and reverberation.",

Rather, it is about the built environment that the ordinary people live in. Instead of the architectural techniques, we use stories to understand the processes through which people make their building decisions.\n\nWe use Asia as the backdrop for the discussion of these topics. Partly because of Asia\u2019s rich heritage and diversity, but also due to the unique complexity that the people in the region face as they go through rapid economic, social, and cultural changes.\n\nIn this examination of the connection between vernacular buildings and peoples' cultural identities, we will review real-world examples and talk to experts in the field. At the end of this course, you will gain a unique perspective about the everyday environment that you live in - one perhaps that you\u2019ve never had before. You will begin to understand and appreciate the value of the ordinary built environment around you.\n\nWhether you are an avid architect or you simply just care about the built environment you live in, this course is for you.",

This first week we examine several definitions of vernacular architecture and discuss why the topic is especially pertinent in the context of Asia. Alongside the expert discussions and examples, we further discuss the notion that culture is a form of tradition and connect it with Asia\u2019s vernacular architecture.\n\nWeek 2: Climate, Building Materials, and the Vernacular\nVernacular buildings are local and very much influenced by local factors, two of which are climate and local building materials. This week we study how the eight major climatic belts influence people\u2019s building decisions. We also look at how people make use of locally available materials, and how construction methods and building rituals are passed from one generation to the next.\n\nWeek 3: Vernacular Landscapes and the Rural Built Environment\nThis week we talk about the vernacular landscape. We define what it is, the meaning of it, and through the lens of the rural vernacular environment, we appreciate the seemingly un-self-conscious process of building that is indeed timeless.\n\n\nThis week we focus on cities, or the urban vernacular. We discuss the process through which the urban vernacular is built, we also delve deep into topics such as sense of place, types of urban vernacular buildings, and how the urban vernacular evolves over time.\n\n\nHave you ever paid any attention to the slum areas in cities? Why do they exist? Are they of any significance or vernacular value to people and society? Termed informal settlements, we look at these built environments in cities through economic, cultural, and social lenses, and connect this unique type of urban vernacular with the future of cities.\n\n\nIn this concluding week, we differentiate conservation from preservation and discuss the challenges and approaches to conservation of Asia\u2019s vernacular built environment. We also discuss the future of vernacular architecture in Asia by contrasting tradition and modernity, and by asking the question of how they can coexist. We argue that the best way to ensure the continuation of the built heritage in Asia is to view vernacular architecture as a living tradition that evolves with time but without losing its cultural value.",

Learners will be introduced to the basic elements of sustainability assessments (first model layer), as well as trends informing the space today. \n\nThe coursework enables students to develop a conceptual neighborhood model for assessing performance and urban policies. \n\nIn the first week, participants will learn to develop a conceptual model from the architectural elements of buildings; the basic building block of which will be the performance of materials. The second week explores methods of optimizing performance. Coursework will detail the needs and constraints inherent in selecting materials and neighborhood urban elements (the second model layer for green, blue and grey infrastructure).\n\nIn the third week, learners will develop the basic tools for introducing energy and measuring the potential impact on climate change (CO2). A new layer (third) on our neighborhood stainability model, this will be approached from a global perspective. In the fourth and final week, the course will explore techniques for a joint assessment directly connected to policy issues.",

        "syllabus": "Module One\n-In this first week, we set the foundation for more advanced things to come. We talk about voicing of chords, voice leading of root position chords, and texture types. This first week might be review for some of you. If that's the case, the videos are still worth watching, I think, because they give a grounding for the thinking behind the music we will explore over these next 6 weeks. (You can always watch the videos at 1.5x or even 2.0x speed, but don't tell the instructor I told you that.) Even something as basic as voicing a chord involves issues of style, and approaches to these issues really give us a better understanding of the perspective of the composers making this music. Please note that there are two assignments for the week. There is a quiz designed to help you review the week's concepts. I would recommend taking it before you do the other assessment this week, which is a self-assessed chorale writing assignment. I use self-assessed assignments in this course as a way to deal with the limits of online learning. Ideally, I would look at all assignments and give feedback. When a class like this is taught at university, it is generally in groups of 20-30 students so students can get personalized feedback. However, that's clearly not possible online. I've tried to design these self-assessed assignments so that the videos really prepare you for the them and it is essentially practice of what we learn in the videos. This is easier in the beginning of the course than towards the end. As the topics become more complex, options multiply and hence correct solutions multiply and solution sheets become less helpful. For those who really do want to get weekly feedback, I encourage you to organize study groups via the forums to share your results and give each other feedback. Student-to-student teaching can be very valuable for learning, especially online. Please do not post your solution on the forum though because it's not permitted. Use the forum just to organize your groups.\n\nModule Two\n-In this module, we expand out harmonic palette by introducing commonly found inversions of the chords used in our basic progressions. We also look at keyboard voicing. The voicing rules used for SATB are generally followed in instrumental music, but they aren\u2019t appropriate for all textures and instrumentations. Keyboard voicing is an approach to voicing homorhythmic, homophonic harmony for keyboard. But once one knows how to do keyboard voicing, one can apply patterns to the two hands and create accompaniment parts relatively easily. We\u2019ll even look at creating a somewhat complex arpeggiated passage similar to a texture used in one of Schubert\u2019s Impromptus. You will see how homorhythmic texture can be a skeleton for creating other texture types. A note about the assignments: we have 2 writing assignments. Please do them in order. Assignment 2 uses the solution from Assignment 1. So, try not to look at Assignment 2 before you\u2019ve completed Assignment 1. There is also a quiz.\n\nModule Three\n-In this module, we look at a few commonly found sequential progressions. We will do some analysis of excerpts from Mozart and Beethoven that demonstrate the use of these types of progressions. I will also show you how to apply patterns to these progressions to make 3-voice polyphonic passages. We will also look at what I call the circle of fifths progression. The term can cause some confusion, so I want to quickly address that here. We are probably all familiar with the circle of fifths since it is commonly used to teach keys and key signatures. If we descend or ascend in a series of perfect fifths, we cycle through all of the 12 keys. Starting at C, ascending gives us keys with sharps, descending gives us keys with flats. When we ascend/descend by a perfect fifth for a 13th time, we end up back where we started. The circle of fifths progression, however, does not use perfect fifths exclusively. In many instances, it simply can\u2019t because doing so forces a key change, and this is frequently not desired by the composer. So, sometimes the perfect fifth is adjusted to a diminished 5th to keep the progression in the same key. You could look at the circle of fifths progression we examine this week as a diatonic version of the original circle of fifths concept. With it, we cycle through not all 12 keys, but all 7 chords of the key. Some of you may know this progression simply as the circle progression. There is one self-assessed assignment.\n\nModule Four\n-In this module, we look at the idea of chord substitution. All of the substitutions we will learn about this week are diatonic, that is, the substituting chord is within the key of the passage. Melodic writing is also introduced, and in the 3 parts of Lesson 7, I walk through creating an entire passage of music from a very simple 2 voice outline. Along the way, I try to articulate the things that one thinks about when creating and working with a melody within a phrase. We will also look at the kinds of harmonic progressions that take place at the end of a phrase. These are called cadences, and they are crucial for the experience of form in common practice music. With cadences introduced, we will be able to take a look at one of the simplest forms found - the period form. With the concepts and techniques learned in this module, you will be able to take a short 4-8 bar passage and generate a small composition from it. In fact, the assignment for the week is to take a sketch of a 5-bar phrase and turn it into a 10-15 bar simple composition that uses a parallel period form. The description of the assignment should tip you off to the fact that the \u201csolution\u201d is just one possibility. Previously, there were always more solutions that the one given, but not many more. This week is different. There will be a bunch of solutions, but I do feel that the solution given is a good implementation of the things learned in the week\u2019s lectures. I would suggest, then, to use your study groups (or to form study groups) to share some of your solutions since they will differ in some ways from the given one. It would also be good preparation for the final project, where you will give such feedback when assessing your peers. I want to also note that while your solution might differ in details from mine, the more general aspects - structure, cadence types and locations, for instance - should not. I want to remind everyone that all of these different ways of engaging with the assignment - completing it, checking it against the solution, getting feedback from others, and giving feedback - are part of the learning process.\n\nModule Five\n-This module builds off of the concept of chord substitution that was introduced previously. However, this week we look at chords that are chromatic, rather than diatonic. Some of you may be familiar with the concept of chromaticism. Its simplest definition is the use of chords that are not part of the key of the passage in which they are used. One of the things that chromaticism helps to make possible is modulation to new keys, so sometimes people think that chromaticism is music that changes keys. That\u2019s not completely true - although it is often the case. In Write Like Mozart we will look only at uses of chromatic harmony that do not cause modulation. (Modulation is a large topic that would take perhaps 2-3 weeks to properly cover, and we just don\u2019t have the space here.) We will also get our feet wet with 2-voice counterpoint. We will look at writing 2:1 counterpoint, that is, 2 notes in the upper voice against 1 note in the lower voice. Counterpoint can go much deeper than this, but it is a subject on its own and also well beyond the space we have in this course. However, I did want to give some guidance in it because we will look at a Bagatelle by Beethoven this week in which he uses 2-voice counterpoint. Since this work could serve in part as a model for your own final project composition, I thought it would be good to take a bit of time to give you some insights into how to write simple 2-voice counterpoint.\n\nModule Six\n-This final module starts with an introduction to what I call \u201cprogressions within progressions\u201d. Often a composer uses V-I progressions that are in keys related to the original key but not actually in it. So in the key of C major, for instance, it is quite common to see a progression that has a D major chord going to a G major chord. Well, up to now, we haven\u2019t seen this and we wouldn\u2019t have a way to describe it. That D major chord isn\u2019t in the key of C, it\u2019s not a Neapolitan or Augmented 6. It\u2019s not a borrowed chord because neither C major nor c minor has a D major as the chord on the second scale degree. However, this D major is a fifth above the G major chord, which means that there is a dominant-tonic relationship between the D major chord that\u2019s not in the key and the G major chord that is. This sounds more confusing than it is, so I won\u2019t continue to describe it here. Instead, I encourage you to check out the videos on this concept, which I think make it quite clear what these are and how to use them. For those who have studied harmony before, you might be familiar with the much more common term \u201csecondary dominant\u201d. That\u2019s what these progressions within progressions are. We will also look at a technique that is crucial to the musical style under examination in this course: the Alberti bass. This is the familiar arpeggiated chordal pattern that you frequently encounter in music from this era. They are easy to write, but there are a few things that need to be kept in mind when composing them. There are also some videos that aim to bring course concepts together for you. The first is a video on elaborating progressions. While the basic progressions presented in the first week aren\u2019t extensive, we learned how to significantly alter them via chord inversion and diatonic and/or chromatic substitution. But we haven\u2019t looked too much at how to take all of these strategies and put them together to create a unique progression. This video aims to offer that. Finally, we take a close look at a theme from one of Mozart\u2019s very famous theme and variations, part of the K. 331 piano sonata. This is important not simply because it brings together the concepts presented in this class. More importantly, the work can function as a model for you in composing your final project. It is an excellent example of rounded binary form - the form you need to use for the final project composition.",

We begin with a brief history of recording technology, the music industry and the place of world music in that narrative; you are introduced to keywords for talking about music cross-culturally; and then proceed to half a dozen musical cultures around the world. In each of these musical cultures, we examine the ways in which music works in those distant cultures, how it sounds, what it means, who may perform it; and then we ask ourselves where this music has traveled and entered into the Western popular culture as entertainment, political discourse, or artistic purpose.",

We reflect on the two opposite meanings of the word \"appropriate,\" examine multitrack recording, and consider the \"collaborative\" process in world music production.\nWeek Three: Tuvan Throat Singers, we examine how nomadic pastoralists from the Russian republic called Tanna Tuva have become world music superstars because of a single field recording made by an ethnomusicologist in the late 1980s.\nWeek Four: Pygmy Pop? We discuss \"pygmies\" in the western imagination, and uses of \"pygmy\" music in northern hemisphere popular culture to ask about the ethics of recorded music appropriations.\nWeek Five: Australian Aboriginal group Yothu Yindi embraced a discourse of cultural and musical reconciliation, and mixed the language of rock with traditional sounds as a successful political strategy in the 1990s.\nWeek Six: Kalahari Bushmen or Khoisan, are perhaps the oldest existing human communities. We discuss their traditional music, the 1970s Gods Must Be Crazy commercial film, and appropriation and reclamation of Khoisan heritage by South Africans in post-apartheid South Africa.",

These classes I'm making for Udemy use the same syllabus I've used in my college classes for years, at a fraction of the cost. I believe anyone can learn Music Theory - and cost shouldn't be a barrier.\nMy approach to music theory is to minimize the memorization. Most of these concepts you can learn by just understanding why chords behave in certain ways. Once you understand those concepts, you can find any scale, key, or chord that exists.

La liberalizaci\u00f3n de algunas patentes y el descenso del coste de las impresoras est\u00e1n acercando la impresi\u00f3n 3D a casi todas las personas. Desde sus inicios en los a\u00f1os ochenta del siglo XX, la impresi\u00f3n 3D ha ido perfeccionando tanto la propia impresora como diversificando los materiales que pueden emplearse. Por esta raz\u00f3n, se propone este curso para conocer las herramientas b\u00e1sicas de este proceso aditivo de fabricaci\u00f3n de objetos desde un soporte digital (dibujos realizados con alg\u00fan software: Blender, SketchUp, etc.), animado con ejemplos para que los usuarios pueden llevarlos a cabo (piezas de drenes, etc.). Este curso se plantea como la primera aproximaci\u00f3n a este mundo de la impresi\u00f3n 3D con vistas a profundizar en posibles futuros MOOCs (\"Construcci\u00f3n de drones apoy\u00e1ndose en impresi\u00f3n 3D\", \"Dise\u00f1o avanzado con softwares para impresi\u00f3n en 3D\", etc.).",

        "syllabus": "Introduction\n-A brief introduction to the topics and goals of this Interaction Design Specialization\n\nNeedfinding\n-This module\u2019s videos and assignment cover a really important topic: where can you get good design ideas from? Ideas that help you create meaningful designs that have a real impact on real people\u2019s lives. Of course, good ideas come from lots of places. And wherever they come from, great. There are a few strategies I\u2019ve found that are especially valuable, and that\u2019s what we cover in this module\u2019s videos. Given our focus on *real* people, we focus on going out, watching what people do, and talking to them. Check out the first video, describing participant observation. Combining observation with interviewing (the second video) provides a powerful foundation for needfinding and brainstorming.So what happens after you\u2019ve observed a lot of stuff -- how do you connect the high-level needs to concrete design ideas? To help you bridge this gap, this module closes with a video on Creating Design Goals.\n\nRapid Prototyping: Wizard of Oz Prototyping\n-This module's lectures introduce storyboarding and several strategies and media for rapid prototyping, including paper, Wizard of Oz Prototyping, and video. An important part of the creativity of a designer is to think about how you can rapidly prototype and get feedback on your ideas. Because it's almost never the case that the first idea you have will be the best. As a designer, you can learn the most when you're creating and getting feedback on multiple alternatives. Your work will nearly always benefit from thinking broadly to find the right design, and then from lots of polish to get the design right. Prototyping is also a great way to achieve common ground across the design team and other stakeholders. We begin with storyboards, paper prototyping and mockups. Students often ask about the relationship between needfinding and prototyping: how closely does one flow into the other? Ultimately the quality of your final design is the real measure and there are lots of ways to get there. While most design work benefits from prototypes directly informed by the needfinding process, it's not required. This module seeks to introduce you to doing human-centered design, and walk you through one path that such an approach could take. In both this Specialization and in real life, you are welcome to revise your ideas as much as you like.\n\nHeuristic Evaluation\n-With this module's videos, we turn our focus from brainstorming and prototyping to the concrete elements of interaction design. We introduce ten key principles of good design -- like the importance of feedback and helping people recover from errors. We call these heuristics -- watch the first video here. I hope you'll find these heuristics practical and applicable to your work both inside and outside class. The lectures discuss these heuristics with a bunch of examples drawn from real-world designs. The goal is to illustrate the many ways that designs can be successful or run into trouble. While heuristic evaluations (HEs) focus on issues that lead to improvement they can also identify areas we think show successful compliance with a heuristic",

        "syllabus": "Introduction to Roman Architecture\n-Roman urbanism and introduction to the wide variety of Roman buildings covered in the course.\n\nIt Takes a City: The Founding of Rome and the Beginnings of Urbanism in Italy\n-Evolution of Roman architecture from the Iron Age through the Late Republic with emphasis on city planning, wall building, and early Roman temple architecture.\n\nTechnology and Revolution in Roman Architecture\n-The Revolution in Roman Architecture through the widespread adoption of opus caementicium (concrete) used for expressive as well as practical purposes.\n\nCivic Life interrupted: Nightmare and Destiny on August 24, A.D. 79\n-Civic, commercial, and religious buildings of Pompeii buried by the devastating eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79 and later rediscovered. Daily life in Pompeii is illustrated through its bakeries and fast food stands and a moving account dramatizes what happened when disaster struck.\n\nLifestyles of the Rich and Famous: Houses and Villas at Pompeii\n-Domestic architecture at Pompeii from its beginnings to the eruption of Vesuvius with emphasis on the development of the domus italica and the Hellenized domus and featuring the House of the Faun and Villa of the Mysteries.\n\nHabitats at Herculaneum and Early Roman Interior Decoration\n-What befell the city of Herculaneum\u2019s inhabitants when they tried to escape Vesuvius. The development of the city\u2019s domestic architecture, especially the Houses of the Mosaic Atrium and the Stags, is traced as is the evolution of First and Second Style Roman wall painting, the latter transforming the flat wall into a panoramic window.\n\nGilding the Lily: Painting Palaces and Villas in the First Century A.D.\n-Third Style Roman wall painting in villas belonging to elite patrons. Third Style painting is characterized by departure from perspectival vistas and return to a flat wall decorated with panel pictures and attenuated architectural elements. The Fourth Style is a compendium of all previous styles. Both coexist in Nero\u2019s Domus Aurea.\n\nExploring Special Subjects on Pompeian Walls\n-Painted renditions of special subjects inserted into Second through Fourth Style Roman wall paintings. These include mythological, landscape, genre, still life, and history painting, as well as painted portraiture. Highlights include the Dionysiac Mysteries paintings and the Riot in the Amphitheater, both from residences in Pompeii.\n\nFrom Brick to Marble: Augustus Assembles Rome\n-Transformation of Rome by Augustus. Claiming to have found Rome a city of brick and leaving it a city of marble, Augustus exploited marble quarries at Luna (modern Carrara) to build his Forum, decorating it with replicas of Greek caryatids associating his era with Periclean Athens. The contemporary Ara Pacis served as the Luna marble embodiment of Augustus\u2019 new hegemonic empire.\n\nAccessing Afterlife: Tombs of Roman Aristocrats, Freedmen, and Slaves\n-Sepulchral architecture in Rome under Augustus. Roman tombs were built in a variety of personalized forms among them the pyramidal Tomb of the aristocrat Gaius Cestius, and the trapezoidal Tomb of Marcus Vergilius Eurysaces, probably a former slave who made his fortune overseeing the baking and public distribution of bread for the Roman army.\n\nNotorious Nero and His Amazing Architectural Legacy\n-Architecture under the Julio-Claudian emperors: Tiberius' Villa Jovis on Capri, and, in Rome and at Portus, the eccentric architecture of Claudius with its unique combination of finished and rusticated masonry. The culminating masterwork is Nero\u2019s Domus Aurea with its octagonal room, one of the most important rooms in the history of Roman architecture.\n\nThe Creation of an Icon: The Colosseum and Contemporary Architecture in Rome\n-The Flavian dynasty of Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian. Vespasian linked himself to Divus Claudius by completing the Claudianum, distanced himself from Nero by destroying part of the Domus Aurea, filling in the artificial lake and replacing it with the Colosseum. Titus commissioned Rome's first preserved example of the \"imperial bath type,\" characterized by grand scale, axiality, and symmetry.\n\nThe Prince and the Palace: Human Made Divine on the Palatine Hill\n-The Domitianic Arch (and Tomb) of Titus celebrating the Flavian victory in the Jewish Wars; the Stadium of Domitian, its shape now preserved in Rome's Piazza Navona, the Imperial Palace on the Palatine Hill, designed by Rabirius and featuring Domitian as dominus et deus, and the Forum Transitorium, a narrow space with undulating columnar bays announcing the beginning of a \"baroque\" phase in Roman architecture. First Quiz is located here!\n\nThe Mother of All Forums: Civic Architecture in Rome under Trajan\n-Trajan\u2019s monumental architecture in Rome references his expansion of the Roman Empire to its furthest reaches. Highlights include the Baths of Trajan and the Forum and Markets of Trajan, built on land that engineer/architect Apollodorus of Damascus created by cutting away part of the Quirinal Hill. The complex also includes the celebrated 125-foot Column of Trajan with a spiral frieze commemorating the emperor's military victories in Dacia.\n\nRome and a Villa: Hadrian's Pantheon and Tivoli Retreat\n-Architecture in and around Rome during Hadrian\u2019s reign: the Temple of Venus and Roma possibly designed by Hadrian; the Pantheon, combining the marble porch and pediment of a traditional Greco-Roman temple with a vast concrete cylindrical drum, hemispherical dome, central oculus, and theatrical light effects; the Villa of Hadrian at Tivoli, where the emperor recreated buildings and works of art observed during his empire-wide travels; and the Mausoleum of Hadrian (Castel Sant'Angelo).\n\nThe Roman Way of Life and Death at Ostia, The Port of Rome\n-Tour of Ostia, characterized by multi-storied residential buildings and widespread use of brick-faced concrete. The city's public face features the Forum, Capitolium, Theater, and Piazzale delle Corporazioni with its black-and-white mosaic shipping company advertisements. The Insula of Diana, a four-floor brick apartment building, and warehouses like the Horrea Epagathiana highlight the Ostian appreciation of the aesthetic qualities of exposed brick facing.\n\nBigger is Better: The Baths of Caracalla and Other Second-and Third-Century Buildings in Rome\n-Exploration of a \"bigger is better\" philosophy; exposed brick tombs with painted stucco and architectural elements; the Temple of Divine Antoninus Pius and Faustina and its post-antique afterlife as the Church of S. Lorenzo in Miranda; the earliest surviving triple-bayed Arch of Septimius Severus in the Roman Forum; the Septizodium, a lively baroque-style fa\u00e7ade for Domitian's Palace on the Palatine Hill; and the colossal Baths of Caracalla\n\nHometown Boy: Honoring an Emperor's Roots in Roman North Africa\n-Timgad, Trajan\u2019s colony for Roman army veterans, was designed as a castrum; Leptis Magna, with Carthaginian roots, was developed first under Augustus. Leptis-born Septimius Severus renovated his hometown featuring a forum, basilica, and arch. Entrepreneurs, providing animals to Rome's amphitheaters, commissioned Hunting Baths with intimate vaulted spaces revealed on the outside and silhouetted against the sea, suggesting that they knew how to innovate and enjoy life.\n\nBaroque Extravaganzas: Rock Tombs, Fountains, and Sanctuaries in Jordan, Lebanon, and Libya\n-The baroque phenomenon in ancient Roman architecture where the traditional vocabulary of architecture (columns, pediments, et al) is manipulated to enliven building fa\u00e7ades and inject them with dynamic motion. Appearing in Rome in the late first century A.D., baroque architecture was foremost in the Greek East where high-quality marble and expert marble carvers made it the architectural mode of choice. It foreshadowed Borromini\u2019s showpieces of seventeenth-century Rome.\n\nRoman Wine in Greek Bottles: The Rebirth of Athens\n-The rebirth of Athens under Rome\u2019s foremost philhellenic emperors, Augustus and Hadrian. High quality Greek marble and expert Greek stone carvers produced notable edifices in Roman Greece dependent on a mutual exchange of architectural ideas and motifs between Rome and Athens. These include the Monument of Philopappos, the Library and Arch of Hadrian, and architectural additions or transformations made to the Acropolis and the Greek and Roman Agoras.\n\nMaking Mini Romes on the Western Frontier\n-Romanization was meant to provide amenities to Rome\u2019s new colonies while, at the same time, transforming them into miniature versions of Rome. The focus here is on western frontier sites in what are now North Italy, France, Spain, and Croatia. Highlights include: the Theater at Orange, the Maison Carr\u00e9e and the Pont-du-Gard at N\u00eemes, and the Trophy of Augustus at La Turbie.\n\nRome Redux: The Tetrarchic Renaissance\n-Except for the Aurelian Walls, Rome\u2019s third century was an \"architectural wasteland.\u201d Diocletian created a new form of government called the Tetrarchy (four-man rule) with leaders in East and West. Public and private building campaigns in Rome and the provinces reflected the Empire's renewed stability and centered on enhancing or restoring buildings in the Roman Forum and constructing the Baths of Diocletian in Rome and Diocletian\u2019s Palace at Split.\n\n\n\nRome of Constantine and a New Rome\n-Constantine commissioned buildings linked to the pagan past (Baths of Constantine) and others (Aula Palatina,Trier) looking to the Christian future. New architectural ideas abound. The \"Temple of Minerva Medica\" is decagonal and the Basilica Nova modeled on the frigidaria of Roman imperial baths. The Arch of Constantine commemorates Constantine's victory at the Milvian Bridge and serves as a compendium of Constantine's accomplishments matching those of \u201cgood\u201d second-century Roman emperors.",

        "overview": "Design Thinking is an innovation approach, which evolved through the past 10 years from a university program at Stanford and HPI Potsdam to a globally respected and universally applied set of methods and tools for supporting and driving change towards a networked culture in organizations.\nThe course is an introduction to the core principles of Design Thinking, explains its cultural impact and inspires to actively use Design Thinking at the organizational level.\nThe course is valuable for decision makers, who want to get an idea about the strategic underpinnings of design thinking. They will learn the terminology and get a better understanding, why and how to use Design Thinking to make the transformation towards a networked organization.\nThe course is not a substitute for a real design thinking-workshop, which will give - at its best - the deep and diverse team experience in a creative environment to the participants. But it helps, to get a better understanding of the core concepts behind Design Thinking and supports the development of their transformational strategy.\nJoin openHPI's official Twitter Feed: @openHPI.

From its humble beginnings as dance hall entertainment, jazz is now embraced as an art form, respected and imitated the world over.\nThis music course addresses jazz from a listener\u2019s perspective, but calls on professional jazz musicians to help us engage with this often mysterious aural experience. This six-week course will enable interaction with the basic components of jazz (swing, improvisation, structure and personal expression) while providing an inside connection to the artists who perform it.\nContent includes excerpts from the 300+ video interviews gathered with jazz personalities for the Fillius Jazz Archive, select scholarly readings and demonstrations offered by the instructor, a working musician. Students will engage in user-friendly activities that include listening, responding, counting, and internalizing the concepts that make jazz work. Rarely heard stories and anecdotes offered by our interviewees will stimulate the imagination and provide rich content for open discussion.\nWe will celebrate the completion of the course with a live concert, streamed to participants of the course, who will also have an opportunity to interact with Monk. \nJazz: The Music, The Stories, The Players will appeal equally to the casual listener, the avid fan and the proficient jazz player.",

Whether you are an active musician, an aspiring musician, or an aspiring music manager or agent - this class is perfect for you.\nFor years I've been teaching Music Theory in the college classroom. These classes I'm making for Udemy use the same syllabus I've used in my college classes for years, at a fraction of the cost. I believe anyone can learn Music Theory - and cost shouldn't be a barrier.\nMy approach to music theory is to minimize the memorization. Most of these concepts you can learn by just understanding why chords behave in certain ways. Once you understand those concepts, you can find any scale, key, or chord that exists. Even invent your own. If you've tried to learn music theory before, or if you are just starting out - this series of courses is the perfect fit.\nDr. Allen is a professional musician, top-rated Udemy instructor, and university professor.

Shah&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u21e2  &lt;em&gt;&quot;Great for everyone without any knowledge so far. I bought all three parts... It&#039;s the best investment in leveling up my skills so far..&quot; &lt;/em&gt;- Z. Palce&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u21e2  &lt;em&gt;&quot;Excellent explanations! No more or less than what is needed.&quot; - A. T\u00f3th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u21e2  &lt;em&gt;&quot;VERY COOL. I&#039;ve waiting for years to see a good video course, now I don&#039;t have to wait anymore. Thank You!&quot; - &lt;/em&gt;Jeffrey Koury&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u21e2&lt;em&gt;  &quot;I am learning LOTS! And I really like having the worksheets!&quot; -&lt;/em&gt; A. Deichsel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u21e2 &lt;em&gt; &quot;The basics explained very clearly - loads of really useful tips!&quot;&lt;/em&gt; - J. Pook&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u21e2  &lt;em&gt;&quot;Jason is really quick and great with questions, always a great resource for an online class!&quot; M. Smith&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

        "overview": "Typography is the art of manipulating the visual form of language to enrich and control its meaning. It\u2019s an essential area of skill and knowledge for graphic designers. Typography predates modern graphic design by around 500 years; it is rich in rules, conventions, and esoteric terminology\u2014but it remains an exciting space for invention and expression.\n\nIn this rigorous introductory course, we will study, name, and measure the characteristics of letterforms. We\u2019ll consider the pragmatic concerns involved in selecting and combining type. We\u2019ll peek into the rich historical, cultural, and aesthetic histories of familiar typefaces. We\u2019ll discuss time-tested conventions and best practices in setting type, as governed by principles of hierarchy and spatial organization. And we\u2019ll explore the expressive, meaning-making potential of type.\n\nInformative lectures will be complemented by a series of three peer-assessed assignments, culminating in an opportunity to design a full-scale typographic poster.\n\nPlease note that this is not a software course; a basic working knowledge of Adobe InDesign or other page layout software will be assumed. You will need access to a computer and page layout software, such as InDesign, to complete the assignments.",

        "syllabus": "Week 1: Talking Type\n-This week, we\u2019ll take an up-close look at typefaces, both as physical artifacts and as works of design. We will study the formal elements that define and give character to type, and understand where they came from and why they look the way they do. We will review the terminology and measuring system used to describe type, and look at the way the form and proportion of letters relate to the practical concerns of selecting and combining typefaces. The week will wrap up with a graded quiz.\n\nWeek 2: Typefaces and their Stories\n-This week, we\u2019ll explore the way typefaces express connotative meaning\u2014tell stories\u2014through their association with different time periods, aesthetics, and ideas. Through six short case studies, we will look at the way a typeface\u2019s connotations are shaped by its context, understand the historic evolution of typographic forms, and familiarize ourselves with the way typefaces are classified. You\u2019ll extend your exploration through some independent research into a typeface of your choosing.\n\nWeek 3: Putting Type to Work\n-This week, we will engage the visual principles and conventions of typesetting. We will look at how the spaces between letters, lines, and blocks of type can be manipulated to refine the appearance and control the meaning of type. We\u2019ll explore the ways typographic hierarchy and grid systems can further organize and clarify type. And we\u2019ll survey the rules and conventions that can add polish to your typesetting. You\u2019ll apply your skills and knowledge in a peer-reviewed typesetting exercise at the end of the week.\n\nWeek 4: Making Meaningful Type\n-In our final week, we\u2019ll examine the ways typographic form can dramatically shape the meaning of written language. We\u2019ll survey and analyze possibilities for type treatments\u2014from subtle typesetting choices to dramatic manipulations\u2014by looking at examples of expressive and unconventional typography. At the end of the week, you\u2019ll bring together and apply everything you have learned in this course in the design of a full-scale typographic poster.",

        "description": "Typography is the art of manipulating the visual form of language to enrich and control its meaning. It\u2019s an essential area of skill and knowledge for graphic designers. Typography predates modern graphic design by around 500 years; it is rich in rules, conventions, and esoteric terminology\u2014but it remains an exciting space for invention and expression.\n\nIn this rigorous introductory course, we will study, name, and measure the characteristics of letterforms. We\u2019ll consider the pragmatic concerns involved in selecting and combining type. We\u2019ll peek into the \u2028rich historical, cultural, and aesthetic histories of familiar typefaces. We\u2019ll discuss time-tested conventions and best practices in setting type, as governed by principles of hierarchy and spatial organization. And we\u2019ll explore the expressive, meaning-making potential of type. \n\nInformative lectures will be complemented by a series of three peer-assessed assignments, culminating \u2028in an opportunity to design a full-scale typographic poster.\n\nPlease note that this is not a software course; a basic working knowledge of Adobe InDesign or other \u2028page layout software will be assumed. You will need access to a computer and page layout software, such as InDesign, to complete the assignments.",

This class has been taught for seventeen years at Stony Brook University, and is an accessible introduction to combining arts and computing.\nWe will cover Photoshop CS5 and GIMP, which is a free open-source tool offering the same functionality as Photoshop. Whether you have access to one or the other, you will learn how to create and manipulate digital images, and most importantly, you will become comfortable enough to expand on what you learn here, after the end of our course.\nYou will complete both technical assignments and artistic projects, and learn how to participate in an aesthetic critique. You will be exposed to historical works of art from the 20th and 21st centuries which will offer you a context for your artistic endeavors.\nPeer review is integral to the success of this class; we will also teach you how to give constructive criticism. By the end of the 5 weeks you should have a strong foundation on how to use computers for image manipulation, and expression of your artistic ideas.\nAdditionally, you\u2019ll create an online portfolio of your digital art projects, and be able to communicate ideas about art.

This week, we provide an overview of design thinking: what it is, why it is different, and why we need it in these uncertain times, especially in complex organizations. We\u2019ll examine the four simple questions at the heart of the design thinking methodology, and illustrate that approach with a visit to the Kingwood Institute in the UK. We\u2019ll conclude this module by giving you a chance to hear from some other experts \u2013 Angela Meyer on the visualization tool and Dan Pink on six abilities that matter most.\n\nBEFORE YOU BEGIN, AND ASKING \"WHAT IS?\"\n-Welcome back! This week, we\u2019ll examine the types of problems that are well-suited for design thinking. We'll recognize what we need to do before we begin a project, and then take a deep dive into the first question in the design thinking process, \u201cWhat is?\u201d and the concepts of insights and design criteria. You\u2019ll see how asking \u201cWhat is?\u201d helped improve daily living for adults with autism, their families, and the staff of the Kingwood Trust. Then we\u2019ll look at the Monash University Medical Centre in Australia and how it asked this same question to make patient-centered care a reality. Along the way you\u2019ll learn about two design tools: journey mapping and repertoire.\n\nA MINDSET FOR INNOVATION, AND ASKING \"WHAT IF?\"\n-Welcome back! This week, we'll continue our exploration of repertoire and a \"mindset for innovation\" through two personas we call George and Geoffrey. We'll examine the question \"What If?\" as a way to think about possibilities. You'll look closely at how brainstorming within the design thinking process helped organizations as different as the Federal Drug Administration and the leaders of a small town of Iveragh, Ireland. This week's tools, storytelling and stakeholder mapping, illustrate ways to gather more information about projects and users.\n\nASKING \"WHAT WOWS?\" AND \"WHAT WORKS?\"\n-Welcome to our final week! This week we transition from idea generation to testing by examining the intersection of what stakeholders want and what the organization can sustainably offer. We'll consider the role of prototypes as a way to test our assumptions about a solution, and consider what it takes to launch a solution into practice, and see real-life examples of prototyping and testing in social sectors as diverse as healthcare and agriculture. You'll begin to think about your own social sector challenge you could tackle with design thinking. We end this week with some advice and actions for impact.",

Indeed, he wrote not only a five-movement symphony, but also a narrative program to accompany and explain the symphony.\nThis music course introduces students to the music and programmatic elements of Berlioz\u2019s Symphonie Fantastique, illuminating a new direction for nineteenth-century music. The course\u2019s grand finale is a live performance of the entire symphony by the Harvard Radcliffe Orchestra.\nHarvard\u2019s Thomas Forrest Kelly (Morton B. Knafel Professor of Music) guides learners through Berlioz\u2019s Symphony Fantastique,, highlighting Berlioz\u2019s compostional process, his innovative orchestration, and the reception of his controversial piece of narrative instrumental music.\nYou will learn the basics of Romantic musical style, Berlioz\u2019s creative expansion of the standard orchestra, and the debates surrounding the idea of purely musical narrative in the 19th century.\n\nAdditional First Nights Modules:",

        "overview": "Prototyping allows you to spend ten minutes \u2014 instead of ten hours \u2014 finding an amazing design for your product. This course will guide you through the iterative process of prototyping an app and conducting user research. You will start by making a low fidelity paper prototype, conducting research with users, and using that research to inform your next iteration. Together with InVision we\u2019ll guide you through creating interactive prototypes. This means you don\u2019t have to code an app before putting it in front of users! Along the way, you\u2019ll learn how and where prototyping fits into your app design process and how you can use prototyping to become a better entrepreneur.\n\n\nWhy Take This Course?\nPrototyping is an art that exists to save you time and money in the app development process. It allows you to identify design flaws quickly so you waste as little time as possible building a phenomenal app. By learning this art, you\u2019ll create quality apps faster and have confidence in the viability of your products.\nBy the end of the course, you\u2019ll be comfortable with the prototyping process, be able to get quality user feedback, and use the feedback to create great apps.",

In the first two Modules you will gain a more professional-level understanding of the Design Elements that artists have used throughout history to create successful compositions. Arranging the Elements in ways that lead viewers through their compositions is an essential craft for photographers no matter whether their subject matter is pure documentary or vividly exotic personal expression. In Modules 3 & 4 we survey the essential elements of post-photography image management, using Adobe(tm) LIGHTROOM(tm). Image adjustment software designed for Smartphone photographers rounds out the Course. Since even photographers whose mainstay is a high-end DSLR also must admit to Smartphone use occasionally, and photographers who only use a Smartphone will usually admit that they want to step over to a \"regular\" camera at some point, there is something for everyone here!

        "syllabus": "Elements of Design: Building Blocks of Composition\n-A writer must understand what nouns, adjectives, adverbs, and other word forms are, before putting them together in sentences that make sense to a reader. Similarly, an artist must understand the essential elements of design that must be put together to create a composition that will \"make sense\" to a viewer of their artwork. In this first module you will learn about the Elements of Design so you can understand their functions and use them effectively to guide your viewers to the content you wish to be conveyed by your photographs, whether it be creative, or documentary, regardless of the subject matter.\n\nComposition means putting the Elements of Design together!\n- Most successful photographs are the result of impactful content, control of exposure and focus, and well designed composition. When you finish the courses and lessons in this Module, you will have the understanding of fundamental principles in those essential areas to begin creating expressions you can be proud of. From the knowledge you gained in Module 1, you can now identify Design Elements that are most significant to you and your content. In this Module, you will learn fundamental principles of organization of those Elements through the purposeful communication that comes from Composition.\n\nPhoto Editing Fundamentals 1.0: \"Workflow,\" from Exposure through Adobe\u2122 Lightroom\u2122 Classic\n-In this Module you will learn the fundamental elements of \"post-production workflow,\" for image files created with a digital camera. We will cover the fundamental aspects of the widely accepted software tool Lightroom\u2122. Whether you are using a point-and-shoot, mirrorless, compact, or DSLR camera, the resulting pictures are of limited value unless they are organized and edited beyond the camera in a computer-based environment. You will begin learning the \"best practices\" involved in using the most widely accepted software platforms, and have a foundation from which you can begin the journey of growth in skills in future efforts and studies of \"post-production.\"\n\nPhoto Editing Fundamentals 2.0: SmartPhone Apps\n-Whether you are an iPhone, Galaxy, or other SmartPhone user, you know you have an exciting device to use as a camera, but you probably feel that you are not using all of its potential. You will learn how the addition of solid Photo \"APPs\" can extend the capability of your device, turning it into a powerful photo-editing computer as well as a more sophisticated camera.",

This is the final third of a class which has been taught for seventeen years at Stony Brook University, and is an accessible introduction to combining arts and computing. The other two portions have already been taught this spring, but we will offer them again in the fall:   Introduction to Computational Arts: Image Manipulation and Introduction to Computational Arts: Processing.\nFor sound we\u2019ll be Logic or a combination of Audacity and Soundation. Students can use other Digital Audio Workstations such as Reaper or Ableton Live. The course will provide the essentials of digital audio and culminates with a piece using both recorded and synthesized sound. \nYou will complete both technical assignments and an artistic project, and learn how to participate in an aesthetic critique. This course is more about recording and sound art than about writing traditional music - I will give examples of work which doesn't require a background in traditional music to create. \nPeer review is integral to the success of this class; we will also teach you how to give constructive criticism. By the end of the 5 weeks you should have a strong foundation for how computers work and deal with audio.",

        "syllabus": "Introduction and Definition\n-What are serious games? What characteristics do they have in common with digital entertainment games? And what sets them apart from other media products? In this first module, we set out to define the field. Get ready to immerse yourself and play your first serious game.\n\nThe Theoretical Framework\n-You might be wondering why we keep on playing a game, even though we sometimes lose or get stuck in a level. In this module, you will learn about what is so motivating about games. We will discuss theories and also a practical example of a serious game that encourages commuters to leave their car at home more often.\n\nDifferent Serious Games and Simulations\n-Throughout this MOOC, you will learn that serious games are applicable in various situations. In this module, we introduce a taxonomy of serious games, which is a classification of the different kinds of serious games. We will focus on one type of serious games in particular: simulations. You will see how simulators are used in complex training situations. So get ready to visit the harbor of Rotterdam and a hospital emergency room...\n\nPersuasive Gaming\n-How can a game influence the attitude of a player? In this module, we will dive into a specific kind of serious games: persuasive games. Rhetoric and psychological theories will help you to understand how the process of persuasion works. And we will analyze in practice how persuasive games can help us to feel empathy for poverty-stricken teenagers, what it feels like to have autism or understand the impact of gun violence.\n\nThe Impact of Serious Games\n-By now you probably wonder to what extent serious games actually reach their desired outcome. This seems to be the million-dollar-question, because when an organization invests serious money in a serious game, they would like to be sure it works. But the answer is not that simple. To know more about impact, you need to know more about how it is measured. Therefore, this module is about research methods. We will discuss two of them in more depth: survey research and experiments. Put on your lab coat!\n\nThe Futures of Serious Games\n-Unfortunately, we do not own a crystal ball. In this module we will nonetheless take a look into the possible futures of serious games. Will we be playing games in virtual reality, or will we guide our game characters with our brains? Before we look forward, this module will also provide you with a brief overview of all the things we have discussed so far.",

J.-C. voient se multiplier les \u00e9changes et se d\u00e9velopper les royaumes qui se disputent la supr\u00e9matie.\nL'ensemble du cours est structur\u00e9 par r\u00e9gions avec des cartes de situation. Il met en relation \u00e9troite les documents avec leur environnement. Des cartes anim\u00e9es servent d\u2019appui et permettent de m\u00e9moriser une histoire de l\u2019art ancr\u00e9e dans ses temps et ses lieux. Les connaissances sur l\u2019histoire de l\u2019art antique, en particulier la sculpture, s'inscrivent ainsi dans un cadre g\u00e9ographique facile \u00e0 m\u00e9moriser qui restitue les \u0153uvres dans leur contexte.

You will discover how subtle changes in lighting, composition, and background contribute to creating more compelling images that help communicate science visually. The course also includes interviews with noteable image makers and art directors.\n \nWhile previous experience with a camera will be helpful, it is not essential. In order to complete the course assignments, you will need access to a single-lens reflex camera (a camera that can accept interchangeable lenses), a 105 macro lens, a flatbed scanner, and a smartphone or tablet with camera. Learners without access to this equipment can still benefit from the course concepts. However, full participation in the image making assignments will create more meaningful hands-on experience. ",

It combines theory with practice, giving you the option to respond to some of the iconic images we will explore, and to create and share your own images.\nIt will provide an introduction to the processes, people and images associated with early photography, starting in 1839 when Louis Daguerre announced the daguerreotype image in France, and WHF Talbot unveiled the calotype process in England. You will have the chance to learn about the personalities, processes and social contexts of the rise of photography.\nThroughout, you will hear from a range of people who are passionate about photography in the 19th century. We will focus on specific images and techniques, ranging from high end studio portraiture, iconic landscapes and cityscapes and the rise of itinerant and beach photography for the masses. There will be opportunity for you, the course participant, to respond to some of these images with your own photographic experiments and to share your own family album.\nThe course is linked to a new major exhibition from the National Museum of Scotland called Photography, A Victorian Sensation.",

Photography became extremely fashionable, particularly in the new carte-de-visite and stereo forms.  Amateur photographer, Julia Margaret Cameron, photographed the writers, artists, scientists in her social circle.\n\nWeek 4 - Stereo Sensation \nFollowing the presentation of the lenticular stereoscopic viewer at the Great Exhibition, viewing the world in 3D became a Victorian craze. The experience of using a stereoscope was described as \u2018mesmerising\u2019. The London Stereoscopic Company, formed in 1854, had as its slogan: \u2018no home without a stereoscope\u2019.\n\n\nWe look at how photography rapidly moves from an expensive, amateur hobby, to reaching the masses, with the growth of cheap \u2018tintypes\u2019 and beach photography, and end with the impact of the Kodak camera, marketed with the slogan \"You press the button and we do the rest\".",

As you learn about different exposure options, the concept and effects of Depth of Field, and begin to study the visual elements in a more concentrated manner, you will be developing the skills to \"put it all together,\" to create pictures you will be proud to share that go beyond the snapshot to more fulfilling expression.\n\nElements of Camera Control 2.0: The Lens\n-In Module 2 you will learn how changes in focal length of the camera lens can have dramatic effects on both the ways that perspective is rendered, and the ways that content of a scene can be altered.\n\nElements of Camera Control 3.0: Depth of Field\n-In Module 3 you will learn about the meaning of \"Depth of Field,\" and how it can be controlled to create areas of focus that are perfect for the type of content you wish to convey in your photographs, whether they are for business or pleasure, art or industry.\n\nPicture Decisions:\n-In Module 4 we return to studying concepts related to the way photographs look, and how practical decisions that are unique to photography can have dramatic effect in terms of what their objective or creative content might be. We examine the aspect of Time as an essential choice that must be made by photographers no matter what their ultimate goal for image-making. We continue the Peer Review process for paid-Learners.",

Now that you have a broad understanding of the various types of cameras, the importance of setting up Menus and Functions to gain control in your photography, and the difference between Auto and Program exposure modes, you are ready to move into even greater Camera Control!  \n\nIn these 4 Modules we will concentrate on gaining the knowledge necessary to make use of Exposure Modes, Light Metering, Effects of various ISO settings, Lens options, using Shutter Speeds to convey aspects of Time in both documentary and creative ways, and exploring the controlled focus effects that Depth of Field Principles make possible.   You will also continue to make new photographs and, if you are a subscriber to the specialization, continue interacting with your fellow learners as you share photographs for Peer Review.  You will also confirm your knowledge through completion of quizzes and written responses.  Let&#039;s get started with Module One!",

In this UX course, you will explore the process of taking a basic concept, grounded in user needs, and developing it into a design that will address those needs. In the course, you will gain hands-on experience with techniques such as sketching, scenario development, storyboarding, and wireframing that will help you transform your understanding of what your users need into a compelling user experience. You will then learn how to turn wireframes and interaction architecture into interactive prototypes that can be tested with prospective users and iteratively refined into a high quality design that that is ready for a hand-off to the development team for implementation.\n\nWhat You\u2019ll Learn:\nDefine and scope the design problem you will try to address\nCreate user stories and storyboards to transform information about user needs into design concepts\nProduce sketches and conduct brainstorming sessions to generate many design ideas from which you can construct a high-quality design solution\nDevelop interface wireframes to concretize the design and enable early user testing\nConduct user tests with paper prototypes to get preliminary user feedback on the design concept and interactions\nDevelop high-fidelity mockups that specify visual design elements\nCreate Wizard of Oz prototypes to efficiently test complex interactions and interactive systems that are not screen-based (e.g., smart assistants)",

        "syllabus": "Introduction to the Design Process\n-In this module, you will be introduced to the nature of design, the design process, and methods of formative research. You are expected to spend 2 to 3 hours on this module\u2019s workload. By the end of this module, you will understand the user experience design process and how to conduct formative research.\n\nIdeation\n-This module will cover one of the practical topics in this course --- ideation. You will brainstorm and sketch possible solutions to your design problem in this module\u2019s assignment. You will also share your sketches with your fellow learners, hear their thoughts about your designs, and provide feedback on their work. By the end of this module, you will gain an understanding of various methods of ideation, as well as the structure developed by Haakon Faste and Eric Paulos for brainstorming.\n\nDesign Constraints and Making Choices\n-This module will introduce the other practical topics --- creation of early design representations like scenarios, personas, and storyboards that illuminate findings about user needs discovered through your formative research. By the end of this module, you will learn how designers move from formative research to a design solution, how the \u201cQuestions, Options, Criteria\u201d framework can help us make design decisions, and gain hands-on experience in creating personas, scenarios, and storyboards.\n\nBuilding Blocks of User Interaction\n-In this module, we will start with understanding the conceptual underpinnings of user interactions by introducing the basic building blocks of user interaction. In addition to lectures, quizzes and discussions, this module involves actual design work: planning out the kinds of information the system you are designing will need to take in, and the kinds of feedback it will need to provide to users. By the end of this module, you will be able to define the elements of user interaction and types of data input. You will also be able to design effective inputs and outputs to enable users to complete tasks successfully as well as conceptualize design problems by using the building blocks of user interaction.\n\nLow to Hi-Fidelity Prototyping\n-Module 5 will provide an overview of different forms of prototyping. Your design work for this module will be wireframing the main screens of your application. By the end of this module, you will be able to identify the characteristics and applications of low-fidelity and hi-fidelity prototypes and apply the most effective prototype for answering a particular design question. Also, you will learn how to test design concepts and functionality by utilizing wireframes and create low-fidelity and hi-fidelity prototypes to assess and improve your design.\n\nConceptual Issues in Prototyping and Design\n-This module introduces some of the issues that designers need to think about when prototyping, such as defaults and mental models. You will create a functional low-fidelity prototype of your design. By the end of this module, you will understand the affordances and limitations of interface formats, learn to evaluate how the default features of a design impact the user experience, identify potential consequences of usage beyond a design\u2019s intentions, and describe the gulfs of execution and evaluation.",

In this UX course, you will explore the process of taking a basic concept, grounded in user needs, and developing it into a design that will address those needs. In the course, you will gain hands-on experience with techniques such as sketching, scenario development, storyboarding, and wireframing that will help you transform your understanding of what your users need into a compelling user experience. You will then learn how to turn wireframes and interaction architecture into interactive prototypes that can be tested with prospective users and iteratively refined into a high quality design that that is ready for a hand-off to the development team for implementation.\n\nWhat You\u2019ll Learn:\n    Define and scope the design problem you will try to address\n    Create user stories and storyboards to transform information about user needs into design concepts\n    Produce sketches and conduct brainstorming sessions to generate many design ideas from which you can construct a high-quality design solution\n    Develop interface wireframes to concretize the design and enable early user testing\n    Conduct user tests with paper prototypes to get preliminary user feedback on the design concept and interactions\n    Develop high-fidelity mockups that specify visual design elements\n    Create Wizard of Oz prototypes to efficiently test complex interactions and interactive systems that are not screen-based (e.g., smart assistants)",

The examples of practice will be drawn from the UK, though the short films we use come from all over the world. There is an inbuilt default in the work we\u2019re drawing on towards French and Spanish language learning, though we will take care to generalise away from specific languages wherever possible.

        "syllabus": "What Is Music?\n-Every day around the world, billions of people listen to music of one sort or another, and millions listen to Western classical music. Why do we do it? Because it\u2019s fun? Because it energizes or relaxes us? Because it keeps us current, allows us to understand what\u2019s happening in past and popular culture? The pull of music--especially classical music\u2014has never been explained. The aim of this course is to do just that: To explicate the mysteries and beauties of some of Western cultures greatest musical compositions\u2014among them masterpieces of Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Wagner, and Puccini. We begin with the elements of music, breaking classical musical into its components of pitch, duration, and sound color, allowing us to better understand how music works. Next, we proceed to the compositions themselves, starting with the Middle Ages and Renaissance, to show how Western music developed in ways unique to the West. Ultimately, we reach the masters, commencing with Bach. What makes his music great? Why does it move us? What should we listen for? And so we proceed down through Western musical history, visiting virtually the people who created it and the places where they did so. By the end, we hope all of us have become more human (enriched our personalities) and had a rollicking good time!\n\nHow Music Works, it's Magic.\n-What is Music? Is music simply the organization of sounds and silences passing through time? Or is it more? Poet Victor Hugo believes music is \"what feelings sound like.\" In this first module, we\u2019ll take apart Hugo\u2019s seemingly simple statement by spending some time asking how and why music induces strong emotions in people across different cultures. We\u2019ll begin with a look at the inner workings of the human ear to determine how our brains process sound waves. Then, we\u2019ll travel to different parts of the world, comparing and contrasting both traditional and popular Western music with sounds from various regions and cultures. You\u2019ll find that it is both culture and the physics of music that determine why we like the music we like! From there, we\u2019ll be ready to take a look at the basic elements of musical composition; rhythm, melody, texture, etc. We\u2019ll also learn how classical composers used these elements in some of their most famous works and how modern artists are still using them today. Finally, we will see how the elements of musical composition have evolved over time and how they have been translated to a universal language enjoyed and understood by millions.\n\nThe Sound of Music\n-Have you ever wondered what it is that makes music sound sometimes rich and luxurious and sometimes strange and mysterious? Well, you\u2019re in luck because this module, we\u2019ll explore what the nature of simultaneous sounds and textures. We\u2019ll start off with a look at chords, specifically how the three types of triads\u2013 tonic, dominant, subdominant\u2013 build a foundation upon which a melody can be constructed. Once we understand the rules of musical syntax, we\u2019ll be ready to learn about musical progressions including the three types of cadences.We\u2019ll also look at major and minor triads and how they work. Then, we\u2019ll learn how to hear the bass and focus on the harmony of a song. Finally, I\u2019ll talk you through the four families of musical instruments\u2013brasses, percussions, strings, and woodwinds---and the various musical textures, forms, and styles that they can create. How exciting!\n\nMusic Back in the Day\n-We will cover a thousand years in musical evolution during this modules lectures! We'll start with the Middle Ages taking a look at its functional chants and dance music, then we\u2019ll move to the period of the Renaissance, and finish off by listening to the ornate melodies of opera heard throughout the early Baroque period. From this, you\u2019ll begin to see how advances in musical notation allowed compositions to become both more specific and more complex. These advances are ultimately responsible for focus being shifted away from the performers and towards the composers themselves.Along the way, we\u2019ll highlight some of these musical inventors and innovators, such as Hildegard of Bingen and Johann Pachelbel. We\u2019ll also have the unique opportunity to see (and in some cases even hear) many of the instruments that were popular during these different time periods. This will be a real treat, made possible with help from Yale instructor, Grant Herreid. Many thanks are owed to him!\n\nThe Baroque Era\n-Novelists, poets, painters, mathematicians, and even geologists talk about \"fugue-like\" structure in their media and disciplines. But what is a fugue and how did we get it? To find out, we enter the world of Baroque music and famed master of the fugue, Johann Sebastian Bach. First, we'll get a chance to \"live\" during the Baroque period by taking a detailed look inside the life, career, and even home of Bach-- explore where and how Bach and his family lived, discuss Bach\u2019s music, and talk about the techniques of Baroque music as a whole. Next, Bach\u2019s music will then be compared and contrasted with that of his exact contemporary and fellow German, George Frideric Handel. One might say that Bach was an idealist and Handel was a realist when it came to music, so we\u2019ll look at how these personality traits informed each composer\u2019s musical style. Finally, we'll wrap up the module with an introduction to music of the Classical Period, and who better to lead the way than the inimitable Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart?\n\nThe Classical Era\n-Would you believe that once upon a time, musical compositions were viewed as disposable, one-time-use entertainment? Could you imagine an orchestra attempting to perform a beautiful piece over the sounds of noisy patrons in a casino? How about a violin being drowned out by a dog loudly barking outside of a caf\u00e9? Well, this was the reality before the turn of the 18th century. It wasn\u2019t until around 1800 that people began to appreciate musical compositions, as they do today. This was the same time we started to see large concert halls created specifically for the purpose of listening to concerts. Not long after, music was seen as something to be elevated and studied, in other words it became, \u201cHigh Art.\u201d This week, we\u2019ll start by listening to music by Haydn and Mozart, getting our grounding, so to speak, in musical form. As we proceed, we'll also see where and how they lived, compare how they wrote and performed their music, and even look at some of the exact instruments they performed on all those years ago.We\u2019ll spend latter part of the module highlighting two figures that stand at the very heart of Western music.The first is Mozart, a well-dressed, confident, eccentric, and ever brilliant innovator. We\u2019ll explore his music through the lens of three artistic masterpieces: a piano concerto, an opera, and the Requiem mass... We\u2019ll delve into the unique features of the music that make it the gold standard for all music for centuries to come. Perhaps the high (or low) point arrives when your instructor is ruthlessness murdered on stage by the feckless Don Giovanni.We\u2019ll then shift over to Beethoven\u2013 a passionate, conflicted, and oft-times disheveled genius. His physical appearance may very well have served as the prototype for the stereotypical, \u201cstruggling bard,\u201d or \u201ctortured genius.\u201d We\u2019ll study some of his most famous sonatas, including his Moonlight Sonata and then go beyond his music to explore his personal life, including his struggle with deafness and depression.\n\nThe Bridge From Classical to Romantic\n-If you could put a soundtrack to the French Revolution, it would surely contain music from Beethoven's \"Heroic\" period, during which, he \u201cbrought sound to symphonies.\u201d We\u2019ll see how Beethoven\u2019s incorporation of new instruments, as well as, his creation of a large orchestra, made his symphonies much louder and \"sonically vivid\" than those of his predecessors. The point of focus here will be a comparison of the music of Beethoven's \"Heroic\" period, represented by his Symphony No. 5, with that of his \"Late\" period, epitomized by his famous Ode to Joy. We'll also consider Beethoven the man, as revealed through primary source accounts of his life at that time. They paint a picture of a disheveled, wild-looking Beethoven, who lived among filth and clutter and was consumed by his work. The ultimate question: in what ways might his life of isolation and his hearing disability affected the nature (style) of the great music he created?As we bid aufwiedersehen to Beethoven, we move on to full-blown musical Romanticism. Romantic music, and indeed all romantic art, was known for its idealistic views on love and nature. Occurring roughly from 1820 to 1900, musical Romanticism saw an evolution of musical style as well as a change of venue (place) for musical performance. In addition to the aristocracy and their royal palaces, a strong middle class arose in Europe during this period. With the music of the ever-lyrical Franz Schubert, we'll step into the parlor of an upper-middle class home, to experience his domestic chamber music and songs. We\u2019ll finish off the module by asking the question: How do we use musical sound to communicate? A look at program music (instrumental music that uses musical gestures to tell a story) will help us figure this out. After a quick auditory review of the workings of program music (we'll follow Vivaldi on a spring day), we'll watch Hector Berlioz go to hell. More accurately, we\u2019ll follow the sequence of musical gestures he employs to re-create a fantastical tale of pursuit, destruction, damnation. Having learned our lesson, we\u2019ll end with a little fun as we try to match themes extracted from various symphonies to the mental images that the composer had in mind. Do you speak the language of program music fluently? Join us and find out!\n\nThe Romantic Era\n-Module 8 will begin with a tour of Yale\u2019s extraordinary keyboard collection; perhaps the finest of its kind in the world. We\u2019ll see fully functioning instruments of all shapes and sizes, some dating back to the time of Mozart and before! We\u2019ll learn the preferred brands and styles of some of the finest pianists of all time, Haydn, Beethoven, Liszt, Chopin, and Schubert to name a few. We\u2019ll even get to hear some of these instruments played by musical educator and concert pianist Robert Blocker. His performances will help us hear exactly how advances in technology changed the sound and capabilities of pianos during this time period. Our next session this module covers a rather polarizing topic: Opera. Many people find the Opera too artificial, too long, and sometimes just plain boring; others enjoy nothing more than this glamorous art form. We\u2019ll spend some time making a case for the power and beauty, indeed the magic, of Opera. Maybe, we\u2019ll be able persuade some naysayers along the way. Because it is impossible to encompass all of Romantic opera in an hour, we'll concentrate on the masterpieces of Verdi and the groundbreaking music dramas of Wagner. Perhaps the only figure who can reasonably by compared to Beethoven in terms of musical originality and innovation, Wagner changed the face of 19th century music. We\u2019ll explore Wagner by briefly analyzing his Ring Cycle. This innovative cycle of librettos, based on Norse mythology, contains some of the most iconic and recognizable music from the period. Wagner's use of \"leitmotifs\u201d made detailed storytelling possible, with the music even conveying the subconscious thought of singers on stage, a truly revolutionary feat. His work would go on to serve as inspiration for writers and film makers such as Tolkien, Lewis, Lucas, and Martin, not to mention countless composers. In the final lesson of this module, we\u2019ll expand our focus to look at the orchestra as a whole during the Romantic period. Just 60 years after Mozart led his thirty-five-player orchestra, it was not uncommon to see Wagner and Mahler conducting ensembles with well over 100 members. In addition to increased numbers, the instruments themselves changed. Technological advances, transformed previously one dimensional instruments, such as the French horn, into versatile tools, capable of projecting a completely chromatic melody. This newfound versatility allowed composers like Brahms and Mahler to experiment with and forever redefine orchestral instrumentation.\n\nMusic to the Present\n-When you think of Impressionism, you probably think of paintings, likely the beautiful canvases of Claude Monet. But the emotionally evocative, non-realistic style of Impressionism pervaded all aspects of art. For music, another Claude, this time Debussy, typified the Impressionist movement. After learning about the sometimes outrageous lives of some of history\u2019s famous composers, it may shock you to hear that Debussy led a rather banal existence, with no depression, psychosis or family tragedy to speak of. But from an ordinary life can come extraordinary music! We\u2019ll look at three pieces, one each from his early, middle, and late career, to see how Debussy's style shifted away from more goal-oriented Romanticism to the \u201clive in the moment\u201d style that came to define Impressionism. After a brief guitar lesson taught with the help of the talented Solomon Silber, we\u2019ll continue on to the Modernist period. As is well known to all by now, musical style is constantly changing. Sometimes the change is subtle, like the shift from Classical to Romantic music. At other times, however, change crashes like a Tsunami against previous traditions. This is what we experience as we engage the bracing sounds of Modernism. Beginning in the early 20th century, composers such as Igor Stravinsky and Arnold Schoenberg abandoned traditional melody and scale. Simply put, audiences were, at times, less than receptive to this change. We\u2019ll listen to samples of the music that provoked audience hostility, and discuss what seems to make this music so inaccessible, at times downright unpleasant, for most listeners.We will close this week, and our course, with Postmodernism and Minimalism. We\u2019ll see how composers like Aaron Copland brought orchestral music back to the people by paring it down to its most basic terms. We\u2019ll then hear how artists such as Philip Glass and John Adams, took this idea and ran with it, composing captivating trance-like movements around the simplest of ideas.",

        "syllabus": "Introduction & Saint-Denis I\n-An introduction to the history of Paris in the centuries of chaos following the death of Charlemagne in 814 and the building of the first Gothic cathedral at Saint-Denis, just north of Paris. The old abbey church, where the kings of France were buried, was inadequate, and so a new building project was undertaken by Abbot Suger, who financed the new building through efficient land management and the commercial Fair of Lendit along a trade route between northern and southern Europe.\n\nSaint-Denis\n-Here we encounter the portrait of Abbot Suger via his account of how and why he built Saint-Denis, what is portrayed on the West fa\u00e7ade of the cathedral, and how the doctrine of God as light, encountered in a book which had come from Byzantium to the abbey centuries earlier, was translated into architectural form. We see some of the objects that are part of the treasury of Saint-Denis and discuss the Abbot\u2019s notion of \u201canagogical uplift\u201d as a way of moving\u2014via stained glass\u2014between the Old and New Testaments and from the material to the spiritual plane.\n\nArchitectural Innovation\n-Filling in the background of Romanesque churches that preceded Gothic buildings, we discuss the origins and engineering innovations of the new style of religious architecture. These include ribbed vaults, reinforced pillars, pointed arches, flying buttresses, and a modular system of bay construction; all of which permits the construction of higher and lighter, thinner walls filled with stained glass.\n\n\nNotre Dame de Paris\n-Moving to the heart of Paris, we explore the initial construction of Notre-Dame and the innovations that were undertaken almost as soon as the building began. We discuss the sculptural programs of Notre-Dame\u2019s West fa\u00e7ade, including the portal which depicts the life of Saint Anne, Christ\u2019s grandmother, and Mary, his mother and the central portal of the Last Judgment. Along the south side, we discover the story of the stoning of Saint Stephen; and, along the North, the miracle of Theophilus and the Virgin. Moving inside the cathedral, we encounter the stunning rose windows of Notre-Dame.\n\n\nIntellectual and Everyday Life\n-Here we examine the cathedral in terms of surrounding intellectual and everyday life. A reading of Peter Abelard\u2019s autobiography, The Story of my Misfortunes, testifies to the growth of the scholastic method in the context of the earliest university culture; and two verse comic tales, \u201cThe Crucified Priest\u201d and \u201cThe Peekaboo Priest\u201d introduce the new mentality of the inhabitant of towns with emphasis on cleverness, quick thinking, and timing along with an anti-clerical spirit.\n\nOur Lady of Chartres\n-In Module 6 we move West of Paris to the cathedral of Chartres where Gothic architecture hits its stride. We explore the history of Chartres, its unique and mysterious architectural features, and its miraculous relic\u2014the Holy Tunic. We discuss the financing of Chartres as seen in the windows donated by merchant which depict the various urban trades alongside the sculpture of the West fa\u00e7ade, the rose and lancet stained glass windows, and the secular Zodiac and Charlemagne windows, the latter of which is linked to important literary works of the period.\n\nCathedrals and Crusades\n-In Module 7 we examine in some detail The Song of Roland, portions of which are depicted in the stained glass of Chartres, and we explore the relationship of relics from the Middle East to cathedral building.\n\nSaints and Kings\n-In Module 8 we explore Saint Louis\u2019s building of the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris as a house of glass, a new Ark of the Covenant, to house the relics he had amassed. Using Jean de Joinville\u2019s Life of Saint-Louis as our source, we encounter the Saint King\u2019s life as a crusader, his death, canonization, and the miracles performed by his body on his way to sainthood.\n\nConclusion\n-By way of conclusion, we explore the history of Gothic cathedrals from the Middle Ages to the present.",

We are confident that it will be a project that you will be excited to share with fellow Learners, and with Professors Peter Glendinning and Mark Sullivan too! A unique feature of this Course is the individual review and responsive input you will receive directly from Peter or Mark, who will be viewing your pictures and making evaluations of all projects at the end of the Capstone. You should plan on spending more time on this Course per week than any other in this Specialization, and much of it will be in making photographs.\n\nDuring the entire period of development, you and your fellow learners will be supporting each other as you work independently, by sharing your work-in-progress from the initial Project Plan to the final Portfolio. At each stage, all Learners will share comments and suggestions with each other, helping each other to gauge progress and to learn about different approaches to photography and content. By expressing your own ideas and expectations about quality in response to the work of others, you will be forming your own criteria of excellence as well.\n\nAlong the way there will be multiple opportunities for sharing pictures and ideas through carefully designed Peer Review. This sharing of photographs and comments with peers, and reflecting on their comments about your photos, will be an exciting learning experience that will help you grow in understanding your own photography and that of others. Your contribution of comments to fellow Learners will not only help them understand their photographs better, but it will give you an opportunity to use the vocabulary of terms that are related to techniques, design principles, and content approaches that you have learned through your success in each of the previous Modules.\n\nA unique aspect of this Specialization is that everyone who completes the requirements will receive, in addition to their Certificate of Specialization from Michigan State University, access to substantial discounts on equipment, accessories, and membership benefits through Industry Partners from among the premier manufacturers of photography equipment and related items: Fracture, Gary Fong, Gyst, Lensbaby, LensPen, Lume Cube Lighting, Photo District News, PhotoVideoEdu, Think Tank Cases/Bags.

        "syllabus": "CAPSTONE PROJECT LAUNCH!\n-The Capstone Project is your opportunity to take advantage of the knowledge you have gained through our journey in learning about photography, to develop a meaningful set of 10 photographs in a final project . Of course, you may well expose hundreds of photographs to get to that final number! This course is where you will combine your passion for a particular content with the skills and knowledge you have developed as a photographer through this Specialization. This is also where you will share your insights with a community of equally passionate photographers through peer review, as they learn from you and you learn from them. Perhaps the project is based in your passion for artistic expression, or for a documentary subject in your community that you feel is worthy of exploration. Maybe you feel moved to create a series of insightful portraits centered on people who are part of a group or of a certain type, or create photographs that are important for your non-photography career (beautiful photos of houses and their details if you are a realtor for example). Whatever the content or subjects, whatever the lighting, exposure, or other techniques used, it begins with an outline, what we call a Project Plan. It goes without saying that all the photographs for this project must be new pictures, created on or after the date of the start of this course. This is not the place for photographs you have created previously, although your new photographs may be related to an area of interest you had before you began this final course. In this first Module you will point your creative compass in a general direction, and with the help of your fellow photographers' feedback gradually create a more narrow, straight, and true path of photography as the weeks of effort go forward. You'll learn from Peter and Mark's mistakes and review a valuable lesson, \"Responding to Photographs,\" from the past. Of course, you will also begin making photographs in that general direction too! Let's get started!!!\n\nLearning from others\n-In this Module, Peter and Mark will comment on projects created by two MSU students and alumni, discussing the strengths they see in form and content to help you begin to form your own judgments as you either agree or disagree with their responses. The process of analyzing one's own preferences, and then actively agreeing and disagreeing about effective camerawork, composition, and content approaches, are key elements in the growth of any photographer. When we convey our honestly held responses in ways that are helpful, we not only give the photographer whose work we are commenting on greater insight into how their work is perceived, but also help open ourselves to new levels of understanding too. The Photographer's Statements by those students are also posted for you to consider, as you prepare to form your own in the future. Our Lesson Review of \"Making not Taking Photographs,\" relates to the purposeful nature of the Capstone Project. In Peer Review, you will help each other gain insights into Project Plans, help each other by making comments and offering suggestions related to the Plans, and share first photographs with each other as well. Remember, the Capstone experience is a Journey, not a Race! If you missed the Reading in Week One, a Fable by Aesop awaits your attention! Take each week for what it is, an opportunity to grow in knowledge, creativity, and photographic technique.\n\nLearning more about critically analyzing\n-Peter and Mark will review two more MSU student projects to help you understand what they see as markers of success in a body of related photographs. Once again, the students' Photographer's Statements are presented as examples of the diversity with which such things may be written. Peter will also discuss the purposes of \"critique,\" also known as constructive criticism, and strategies for analyzing the works of others. Our Lesson Review in this Module is again from Course Three, entitled \"Composition is a \"Map,\" Balance is Bike Riding.\" Finally, you will practice your \"critique skills\" in a Peer Review exercise. Of course, during this week you will keep photographing to develop your project further.\n\nMid-Term review time!\n-At the midway point in this Capstone Course, you will \"get over the hump\" and continue your progress toward the completion of your photography projects! Peter and Mark will each discuss a project that had \"humps\" to get over. This is also the week where you will upload a large set of new photographs, ten to be exact, using the Discussion Forum as our \"gallery,\" and the Peer Review process as a way to share and receive feedback from as many of your fellow photographers as you like. You will not only gain from the perspectives of others, but grow in your abilities to engage the processes of critical thinking and dialogue so necessary to developing your own sense of what makes a photograph a \"success.\"\n\nQuestions and Answers\n-In your fifth week of the Capstone, you are just beyond the half-way mark but quickly closing in on the time when you will have to upload your final portfolio project. There is still time to make adjustments, to fine tune the course you charted in your original Project Plan. With the feedback you received in the Midterm Review, and the experience of reviewing your peers' projects, the full meaning of a \"project\" should be much more clear to you now. This is a perfect time to switch from project planning statements to writing a \"Photographer's Statement\" that conveys in words the significance in your pictures, and we will concentrate on that this week.\n\nInspiration and Perspiration!\n-As Thomas Edison, the great 20th Century American inventor said, \"Creativity is 1% inspiration, 99% perspiration,\" and you can surely appreciate the meaning of that at this point in the development of your projects! In the last two weeks, you have had the opportunity to share and receive comments on your project's progress. There are no doubt questions that have been raised in your own mind about the project. There are also answers that you have found valid in regard to your goals. Use this week to create more photographs and to revise your Photographer's Statement in response to the feedback you have received from Peers. Your Capstone project pictures will be due by the end of next week, the 7th week of this Course 5. You should be making final photographs, fine tuning your Photographer's Statement, and making final decisions about which 10 pictures will comprise your final project. Be inspired!\n\nReveal the Capstone Projects!\n-You have done it! It's time to share your photographs and statements. Following the process described by Prof. Glendinning in his Lecture, you will use the Week 7 Discussion Forum to post your pictures for others to see and reflect on. After we take this week to post pictures and view those of classmates, you'll have the opportunity to share comments in Peer Review in Module 8. You'll also have the opportunity at that later time to make comments directly within this Discussion Forum... but please follow the lecture instructions, and don't post comments too early here!\n\nReview, Reflect, and Go Beyond!\n-Well, here we are at the end of one journey together but at the beginning of another! In this final week, you will continue the process of learning by sharing and receiving comments through the Peer Review process. It will not only give you the chance to formally review 9 of your fellow Learners' projects, but also to make a direct comment to all participants in the Discussion Forum about how your photography will be improved by what you learned from their projects. Going \"beyond\" is something that you have embraced throughout this Specialization, and both Mark and Peter look forward to doing the same for you. They will be reviewing all Capstone Projects throughout the year, selecting the 10 best for individual reviews by Canson-Infinity Ambassadors, some of the most highly regarded photographers in the world! In addition, you will be receiving an email giving you instructions on how to access the substantial discounts that our Industry Partners have provided. Finally, look for an invitation to the secret Facebook group where you can continue to interact with your peers if you like. In the future, as new groups of Learners complete the Capstone and join the \"Alumni\" Facebook Group, you will be joined there by other enthusiastic photographers who have also journeyed through Photography Basics and Beyond, to continue sharing together. Peter and Mark are active members of that Facebook group, and we look forward to our future interactions with you there as well. THANKS for all you have done to make this a positive learning experience throughout all 5 courses. We look forward to continuing the journey in photography with you in the future too!",

        "description": "The Capstone Project is your opportunity to take advantage of the knowledge you have gained through our journey in learning about photography, to develop a meaningful project of 10 well formed photographs based in your passion for artistic expression, or a subject for documentary exploration, insightful portraiture, imaging for work-related subjects, or some other aspect of photography.  We are confident that it will be a project that you will be excited to share with fellow Learners, and with Professors Peter Glendinning and Mark Sullivan too!  A unique feature of this Course is the individual review and responsive input you will receive directly from Peter or Mark, who will be viewing your pictures and making evaluations of all projects at the end of the Capstone.  You should plan on spending more time on this Course per week than any other in this Specialization, and much of it will be in making photographs.\n\nDuring the entire period of development, you and your fellow learners will be supporting each other as you work independently, by sharing your work-in-progress from the initial Project Plan to the final Portfolio.  At each stage, all Learners will share comments and suggestions with each other, helping each other to gauge progress and to learn about different approaches to photography and content.  By expressing your own ideas and expectations about quality in response to the work of others, you will be forming your own criteria of excellence as well.  \n\nAlong the way there will be multiple opportunities for sharing pictures and ideas through carefully designed Peer Review.  This sharing of photographs and comments with peers, and reflecting on their comments about your photos, will be an exciting learning experience that will help you grow in understanding your own photography and that of others.  Your contribution of comments to fellow Learners will not only help them understand their photographs better, but it will give you an opportunity to use the vocabulary of terms that are related to techniques, design principles, and content approaches that you have learned through your success in each of the previous Modules.  \n\nA unique aspect of this Specialization is that everyone who completes the requirements  will receive, in addition to their Certificate of Specialization from Michigan State University, access to substantial discounts on equipment, accessories, and membership benefits through Industry Partners from among the premier manufacturers of photography equipment and related items:  Fracture, Gary Fong, Gyst, Lensbaby, LensPen, Lume Cube Lighting, Photo District News, PhotoVideoEdu, Think Tank Cases/Bags.  In addition, The &#039;top-10&#039; peer-reviewed Capstone projects each year will be awarded the opportunity for individual reviews, with personal responses, by world renowned photographers who have been honored with the title of Canson-Infinity\u00ae Paper Ambassadors.",

Vamos explorar um pouco sobre a Capoeira Angola com uma Roda de Capoeira na Bahia, e usar a can\u00e7\u00e3o \"Paranau\u00ea\" como base para a aula.\n\nEscala Maior & M\u00fasica Ga\u00facha\n-Nesta aula, vamos introduzir a escala maior, mais conceitos r\u00edtmicos b\u00e1sicos, e a cad\u00eancia harm\u00f4nica Dominante-T\u00f4nica. Vamos falar um pouquinho sobre a M\u00fasica do Rio Grande do Sul, e usar a can\u00e7\u00e3o \"Prenda Minha\" como base para a aula.\n\nHarmonia Diat\u00f4nica Maior & a M\u00fasica de Minas Gerais\n-Nesta aula, vamos falar sobre harmonia diat\u00f4nica no modo maior e introduzir diferentes f\u00f3rmulas de compasso. Vamos usar a can\u00e7\u00e3o \"Ponta de Areia\" de Milton Nascimento, grande representante da m\u00fasica de Minas Gerais, como base para a aula. Especialmente de um ponto de vista r\u00edtmico, a m\u00fasica de Minas Gerais, principalmente a m\u00fasica de Milton Nascimento, n\u00e3o \u00e9 conhecida por um \u00fanico elemento caracter\u00edstico, mas puxa elementos de v\u00e1rias \u00e1reas do Brasil e de fora tamb\u00e9m, como ritmos dos Andes - e acaba tendo uma certa personalidade e unidade.\n\nEscala Menor Natural & Samba no Rio de Janeiro\n-Nesta aula, vamos introduzir a escala menor natural (modo e\u00f3lio) e suas tr\u00edades, e tamb\u00e9m trabalhar com ritmos mais avan\u00e7ados. Vamos falar sobre Samba, com foco na bateria de Escola de Samba no Rio de Janeiro, e usar a can\u00e7\u00e3o \"Canto das Tr\u00eas Ra\u00e7as\" como base para a aula.\n\nModo Mixol\u00eddio & Bai\u00e3o\n-Nesta aula, vamos introduzir o modo mixol\u00eddio e o acorde de s\u00e9tima dominante. Vamos falar um pouco sobre o Bai\u00e3o, usando a can\u00e7\u00e3o chamada \"Bai\u00e3o\" de Luiz Gonzaga, importante \u00edcone da m\u00fasica do Nordeste do Brasil, como base para a aula.\n\nRevis\u00e3o & Composi\u00e7\u00e3o\n-Nesta \u00faltima aula, vamos revisar brevemente o conte\u00fado do curso em prepara\u00e7\u00e3o para escrever uma pe\u00e7a original de 16 compassos. Ap\u00f3s a revis\u00e3o, voc\u00ea ver\u00e1 um exemplo com alunos demostrando o processo, e ter\u00e1 a oportunidade de escrever sua pr\u00f3pria pe\u00e7a.",

        "overview": "The \u201cIntroducing Metadesign\u201d stems from the need to transfer a methodology, a consolidated research practice able to support the design process. The design process is inextricably linked to all the elements of constraint and context that characterize the reality in which the product/service will be developed, communicated, marketed and used. The course structure foresees the reconstruction in phases and successive elaborations of all the elements of context that come into relation with the object of the design process (product, space, service, communication artifact\u2026) influencing its characteristics and creating the \u201cplatform\u201d of elements that make its development possible. The set of contextual elements is the scenario on which the construction of the design brief is based, that is the explanation of all the elements that contribute to define a new product. This is not the result of a deterministic vision of design as a direct consequence of the elements of context - production, resources, market, context of use - but the formalization of a practice that in the Italian context has historically fueled the ability to continuously and constantly innovate. Design research thus becomes the tool through which the awareness of the system of available resources is built by creating an organized knowledge platform, a metadesign, which already contains all the elements defining the product.\n ",

        "syllabus": "Design Research\n- Our course begins with the first step for generating great user experiences: understanding what people do, think, say, and feel. In this module, you\u2019ll learn how to keep an open mind while learning more about how people\u2019s needs, goals, values play out in their day-to-day lives and their hopes for the future. You\u2019ll consider the different activities they do, in what order, and the larger systems in which they interact. You\u2019ll start by generating lists of questions and move through different research methods to answer your specific questions. To illustrate these research methods, the lessons share several examples from real design projects across a variety of fields. What I hope you\u2019ll take away from this module is the importance and thrill of going out to talk with and learn from people when and where they do their everyday activities, rather than basing your designs on assumptions. Through these techniques you\u2019ll gain a new perspective on the problem and identify opportunities for creating a meaningful and accessible design.\n\nIdeation\n-Once you\u2019ve identified an opportunity area, how do you generate great ideas? In this module, you\u2019ll learn the thrills and challenges of ideation. We\u2019ll start with the two common pitfalls to generating good ideas: fixation and judgment. We discuss rules to follow including getting every idea out regardless of whether it\u2019s good or bad and techniques for building on ideas. Through concrete examples taken from the field, we\u2019ll cover five popular ideation techniques that designers use when they have a problem they want to solve. We\u2019ll also discuss who to include in the brainstorming process and why. We\u2019ll conclude with a discussion of how to choose which ideas to pursue and which ones to leave on the table.\n\nWe hope you'll take away a newfound appreciation for all of the different ways you can generate ideas within an opportunity area and how different techniques and configurations will influence the types of ideas you generate.\n\nSynthesis\n-After you\u2019ve collected all of this new and exciting information, what do you do with it? How do you aggregate the data? Find connections and tensions? Move from what people say to what it means? Evaluate its usability? In this module, you\u2019ll learn how to make sense of the rich data you collected and how to turn it into actionable insights that will lead to meaningful new experiences. We\u2019ll start by looking at how to organize all of the data and photos you\u2019ve collected and then we\u2019ll discuss four common synthesis techniques that designers use: personas, journey maps, diagramming and the 2x2 matrix. After making sense of the data, you\u2019ll be able to identify clear opportunity areas for design including a focus, stakeholder, a need, and an actionable insight. With each technique, I\u2019ll share a real world application so you can get a sense of how designers use these tools. By the end of the lesson, I hope you\u2019ll feel confident in your ability to take lots of disparate bits of data and turn them into an actionable opportunity area for design..\n\nPrototyping\n-After you\u2019ve gone through the ideation process, how do you make your ideas tangible so that you can test them with others and answer critical questions necessary for pushing your idea forward? To help you make ideas real, our final lesson will introduce you to the rules of prototyping including building ideas quickly, making a lot of prototypes, and providing only essential details. We\u2019ll discuss questions you\u2019ll want to ask when testing your idea with different people. You\u2019ll learn the importance of making many prototypes so as not to get attached to any one idea and so you can pick the parts that work best for each idea. Through rapid iteration and testing, you will more quickly get to a meaningful and accessible experience that you will be proud of. We\u2019ll conclude with four popular forms of prototyping including storyboards, role-plays, walkthroughs and touch-points \u2013 all forms of prototyping you can do with materials you can find around your home. No coding needed! What I hope you'll take away from this lesson is a love of making ideas tangible to answer specific questions and how different forms of prototyping will influence the questions you can answer. So we can take all of those ideas written on sticky notes and make them real!",

It is now being offered globally as one of Peking University\u2019s MOOCs.\n\nAddressing students' interests in 20th century Western Music Culture and incorporating music theory, the course examines 20th century Western music. By combining theory and practice, the course not only aims to provide a clear view of the historical development of the music, but also emphasizes the training of aural skills and the accumulation of musical knowledge. The course covers not only classical music, such as neo-classical, expressionism, nationalism and other genres, but also explores in depth jazz, rock, and pop music of the 20th century. While studying Chinese music and other forms of national folk music in the 20th century world music context, students will also analyze large and complex works such as opera, musicals, and film music. By enhancing students\u2019 understanding of 20th century Western music (classical music, pop music, folk music, comprehensive art) as a foundation, three core questions will be addressed: what is music, what is the 20th century Western music, and what is effective listening? The course aims to guide students to examine the three listening modes of 20th century Western music with the hope of forming a diverse and multi-faceted, knowledge and understanding of the 20th-century Western music culture phenomena, expanding students\u2019 horizons, enhancing their ability to reason by analogy, and promoting cross-disciplinary, creative development.",

By combining theory and practice, the course not only aims to provide a clear view of the historical development of the music, but also emphasizes the training of aural skills and the accumulation of musical knowledge. The course covers not only classical music, such as neo-classical, expressionism, nationalism and other genres, but also explores in depth jazz, rock, and pop music of the 20th century. While studying Chinese music and other forms of national folk music in the 20th century world music context, students will also analyze large and complex works such as opera, musicals, and film music. By enhancing students\u2019 understanding of 20th century Western music (classical music, pop music, folk music, comprehensive art) as a foundation, three core questions will be addressed: what is music, what is the 20th century Western music, and what is effective listening? The course aims to guide students to examine the three listening modes of 20th century Western music with the hope of forming a diverse and multi-faceted, knowledge and understanding of the 20th-century Western music culture phenomena, expanding students\u2019 horizons, enhancing their ability to reason by analogy, and promoting cross-disciplinary, creative development.",

        "overview": "From nothingness to place: To learn to stare, observe and see places like architects do. To transform a place into a state of mind.\nArchitecture 101:\nArchitecture to convert a place into a state of mind. Apparently a simple task, actually a fairly tricky operation. To (try to) understand, we split our journey into three parts. This course is about part 1: from nothingness to place (part 2 is from place to space, part 3 is from space to architecture).\nWhat is a place? What is space? How do we make space? How do we prepare our mind to make space?\nWithout a concept, we can\u2019t have a place. Without a place, we can\u2019t have space. Without a space, we can\u2019t have architecture...\nIf we want to create space, in the first instance, it has to happen in our mind. When a conceptual vision takes form in our minds, a place (with its own spatial features) is born.\nArchitecture 101 is an introduction to space and architecture through 101 exercises. A six-month journey divided into 3 courses \u201conline\u201d on iversity (part 1, part 2 and part 3), one final exhibition / graduation party. If you are still alive after all of this daunting process, there will be a one-week workshop \u201coffline\u201d, where we will go one step beyond.",

This is the key question we will try to answer in this course.\nThis architecture course takes you on a journey of understanding and appreciating the value of our everyday built environment. In the first two modules, we will explore the deeper socio-cultural meaning of rural vernacular architecture and look at the urban vernacular and challenges of people migrating from villages to live in cities; in module 3, we will focus on what we call \u2018informal settlements\u2019 in Asian cities; and in the final two modules, we will explore answers to a few questions that are very relevant to the current status and future development of vernacular architecture, such as:\nHow can we conserve and sustain our vernacular cultural heritage?\nHow can we reconcile tradition with modernity and originality?\nWe will also cast our eyes into the future, and discuss how the field of vernacular architecture might evolve and develop in the years to come.\nUltimately, the goal of this 5-week course is to help you establish your own viewpoints about the more complex or even contradictory issues in vernacular architecture, so you can make informed decisions regarding the protection and conservation of your local vernacular environments.",

There will also be a focus on Monteverdi's life and work as a Renaissance court musician.\nIn this music course, you will learn the basics of operatic form and analysis, the genres and styles used, and the circumstances of this opera's first performance and subsequent history.

You're going to actually do, on a small scale, the work that an architect does.What the architect does is to have a certain vision about how things might be better. We're going to give you an introduction to that mindset and to that way of working. The study of architecture really engages all your skills. You learn how to work in teams, you learn how to communicate. You learn how to think critically and analytically. You develop all of your creative skills in the study of architecture. In this first module we are going to do three things. We're going to dispel some of the myths about what you need in order to be an architect. We're also going to talk about what an architect does and doesn't do. Then we're going to work on a short design exercise that begins to stretch your muscles to get you going on the design process.\n\nDesign Analysis\n-What we're going to do in this module is to discuss the work of architecture in a wider context. In this we will explore the relationship the architect has with the environment (both its material environment and its social environment. So, these kinds of questions, this ability to think about an object in its broader context is what we're going to develop. By the end of the module, you're going to be able to think about and map a building's broader context. The social and material context in which a project exists.\n\nCreating Spaces\n-In this module we are going to delve more into the technical side of architecture. We will explore essential principles such as: composition, hierarchy, balance, and space. Having learned how you interact with the environment, this is where you learn how to put your ideas into practice. You will learn what is necessary in order to ensure your structure connects with people living near it and interacting with it on a daily basis. Also, we will explore how architects use the natural and physical environment to stimulate their creative process - taking a look at incredible examples from renowned architects. Finally, you will receive tips on how to succeed in this week's assignment.\n\nDesign Process\n-In this module, we focus on developing the story behind your design. All great architects have great stories and we will give you an insight to some of those in this week. We will show you how you can develop your own story which will enable you to build the necessary emotional connection to your design. Also, we educate you in how to use photography and modern tools like instagram in order to make your design look as attractive as possible to a wider audience. Finally, we will prepare you for your final and most important assignment of the course.",

It also includes the first step of learning, installation of Sketchup.\n\nMagic Cube: familiar with [Line], [Divide], [Push/Pull], [Tape Measure] and [Guides]\n-Here comes the first example, magic cube. The purpose of this module is to help learners be familiar with basic tools in Sketchup, including [Line], [Divide], [Push/Pull], [Tape Measure] and [Guides]. In this module, we will start drawing a cube, then reformed it into steps by using [Divide], create another cube by using [Push/Pull], and finally make a hole on the cube by combining [Push/Pull], [Tape Measure] and [Guides].\n\nToy House: familiar with [Move] and [Arcs]\n-The second example, toy house is designed for learners to be familiar with [Move] and [Arcs]. Inclined roof is a highlight in the example. Learners will understand how to add objects not perpendicular to the reference surface. The module also includes the methods of using [Arcs].\n\nBeach Ball: familiar with [Circle], [Follow me], [Rotate] and [Paint Bucket]\n-The third example, Beach ball is designed for learners to be familiar with [Circle], [Follow me], [Rotate] and [Paint Bucket]. Learners will understand how to draw a sphere using [Circle] and [Follow Me], how to use [Rotate] and [Copy] to draw the surface of the sphere and how to use selection tricks to delete all the unnecessary planes. The module also includes the methods of using [Paint bucket] to finish the beach ball.\n\nCurtain: familiar with [Scale], [Arcs], [Copy] and [Mirror]\n-Here comes the fourth example. This module, curtain, includes more decoration skills. Learners will learn how to create deformations on the curtain by combining [Move], [Measurements box] and [Scale], and how to decorate it by using [Mirror] and [Soften effect].\n\nSolid Tool: familiar with [Subtract], [Union], [Intersect] and [Split]\n-The last example is coming! This module, solid tool, is designed for learners to be familiar with [Subtract], [Union], [Intersect] and [Split]. Learners will learn how to create different shaped objects, by using one object to add or remove a piece of volume to another object.\n\nClosure: Review and preview\n-This module includes course review and a short introduction of next course: 3D CAD Application.",

You'll learn how to conduct fieldwork with people to help you get design ideas. How to make paper prototypes and low-fidelity mock-ups that are interactive -- and how to use these designs to get feedback from other stakeholders like your teammates, clients, and users. You'll learn principles of visual design so that you can effectively organize and present information with your interfaces. You'll learn principles of perception and cognition that inform effective interaction design. And you'll learn how to perform and analyze controlled experiments online. In many cases, we'll use Web design as the anchoring domain. A lot of the examples will come from the Web, and we'll talk just a bit about Web technologies in particular.

You, the student, bring to the course your particular interests and expertise related to, for instance, engineering, furniture, fashion, architecture, or products. In prior sessions of the course about half of the participants were novices and about half had prior professional design expertise. Both groups seem to benefit substantially from the course.

        "syllabus": "Week #1: Introduction to Design\n-This module was designed to introduce you to the design process and to reinforce the critical role that user needs play in good design. You'll learn that design is conceiving and giving form to artifacts that solve problems, and also how to recognize and identify a gap in a problem. You'll explore what defines what users need, as well as ways to use those needs toward product design. By the end of this module, you will have begun your own design process by identifying 10 problem gaps and submitting them for feedback from your peers. You will also do a \"5 Whys\" exercise to help you determine the best design problem for you to solve in your final design project\n\nWeek #2: Customer Needs and Drawing Solutions\n-In this module, you'll deliver your customer needs and learn the basic principles of drawing for product design: a necessary skill for any designer. The module begins with another peer review, this time on customer needs. This assignment requires you to conduct interviews with potential customers, and to come up with a list of at least 30 user needs. Given the time-intensive nature of this assignment, we suggest you begin it as soon as possible. As you conduct your interviews and begin your list of user needs, you can start watching the drawing videos, which will guide you through the processes of presenting your design in a clear, easily accessible format. By the end of this module, you'll be able to identify the main customer needs your design will address, and also be able to present your design as a drawing which employs the best practices of drawing for design.\n\nWeek #3: Design Concepts\n-The goal of this module is to move from defining the problem to designing a solution. You'll begin by learning about the exploration phase, and you will exit this phase with a number of design concepts for peer review. You'll also learn how to decompose a design to evaluate its overall function, and essential process in creating good design essential to the life of your design. Finally, you'll learn how to critically examine past design artifacts to inform your current concepts so that you can sensibly differentiate your product. By the end of this module, you'll have created 10 solid design concepts, and you will have received feedback on those concepts so that you can move to the next phase of the design process: prototyping.\n\nWeek #4: Concept Selection and Prototyping\n-This module was created to help you understand the selection process so that you can choose one design for prototyping. You'll learn key techniques for evaluating your design concepts, including the selection matrix, and the scoring matrix. And once you've selected some designs, you will also learn the uses and value of prototyping. You'll explore how prototypes are used to answer questions, to communicate and to distinguish milestones in the design process, and you will also work through the prototyping process so you can begin building your own, which you will submit for peer review. By the end of this module, you'll have selected one or more design concepts for prototyping, built prototypes, and received feedback on them from your peers. You'll also get to see some of your peers' designs as well.\n\nWeek #5: Aesthetics\n-Now that you\u2019ve identified what concept you want to explore, this module will explore the aesthetics of design so that you can refine your prototypes to be as aesthetically pleasing as possible. You'll learn how aesthetics are used in design, and how they motivate reactions toward artifacts overall using a real-world example. You'll also learn how you can apply these aesthetic principles to your own prototype, so that you can make your prototype more appealing and pleasing to potential customers. By the end of this module, you'll be prepared to implement aesthetic changes to your existing prototype so that you can be ready to submit your final design project for review in the following module.\n\nWeek #6: Final Project Submission\n-In this module, you will submit your final project for review. You'll then evaluate the work of five (5) of your peers and receive feedback which you can use for the next iteration of your design. By the end of this module, you will have created a reasonable prototype, and received critical feedback on how to redesign your prototype so that you know which directions to purse should you continue working on this project after the conclusion of this course.",

There is also a focus on how to present findings from this phase of the design cycle.\n\nDesigning Alternatives\n-The second step of the design cycle is presented. Students are shown how to take the findings from phase 1 (requirement gathering) to design mobile and ubiquitous computing systems that meet the usablility constraints that were identified.\n\nPrototyping\n-The third step of the design cycle is presented. Once the best design is chosen how to we iteratively design models of the system to quickly allow user to interact and provide feedback.\n\nEvaluation\n-The fourth step of the design cycle is presented.

Creativity is explored and applied at two different levels, lower and higher-level creativity. \nThroughout, we're aiming to provoke your thoughts and develop your creative mind through varied activities and interactions.\n\nModule 2\nIn this module, we will look at how we can augment our creativity using different methods of Brainstorming, a creativity approach that aids the generation of ideas in solving a stated problem. We particularly focus on the application of brainstorming tools in group activities, with the aim of enabling you to understand, evaluate and apply different types of brainstorming techniques in your own context.\n\nModule 3\nWe will focus on the principles as well as application of the 6 Hats thinking tool both at an individual level and in a group, under various professional and personal situations, allowing you to develop competency and accelerate proficiency on the use of technique.\n\n\nYou will become familiar with the Principles of Morphological Analysis and learn how to apply it in various life scenarios, from design to developing movie plot-lines, whilst developing a more systematic approach to idea generation. \n\n\nIn Module 5, we continue to enhance your fluency, flexibility and originality of idea generation by introducing you to another creativity tool called the theory of inventive problem solving (TRIZ). We will particularly focus on application of TRIZ and the TRIZ Contradiction Matrix and how it can be used in problem, both at an individual and in group level. \n\n\nThis module we will introduce you to the final creativity tool in the course and its importance in generation of ideas and improvement of the existing ones; SCAMPER. You will become familiar with the concepts of SCAMPER and gain proficiency in its application in various unusual, personal or professional situations, whilst inspiring related ideas.\n\n\nNow that you have mastered a wide range of creativity tools and developed competency in their application over a wide range of situations and domains, we will wrap up by asking you to use these tool in combinations and apply these in context and scenarios that are also related to your own discipline or context. This will help you reinforce the concepts that you have learnt so far and enable you to use the creativity tools freely in problem solving and idea generation.",

        "overview": "How do we understand architecture? One way of answering this question is by looking through the lens of history, beginning with First Societies and extending to the 16th century. This course in architectural history is not intended as a linear narrative, but rather aims to provide a more global view, by focusing on different architectural \"moments.\"\nHow did the introduction of iron in the ninth century BCE impact regional politics and the development of architecture? How did new religious formations, such as Buddhism and Hinduism, produce new architectural understandings? What were the architectural consequences of the changing political landscape in northern Italy in the 14th century? How did rock-cut architecture move across space and time from West Asia to India to Africa? How did the emergence of corn impact the rise of religious and temple construction in Mexico?\nEach lecture analyzes a particular architectural transformation arising from a dynamic cultural situation. Material covered in lectures will be supplemented by readings from the textbook A Global History of Architecture.\nJoin us on a journey around the globe and learn how architecture has developed and interacted with the world\u2019s culture, religion, and history.",

Adem\u00e1s, reforzaremos la idea de tecnolog\u00eda blanda.\n\nLa tecnolog\u00eda es apropiada por personas y comunidades\n-En esta lecci\u00f3n nos centramos en el proceso de apropiaci\u00f3n tecnol\u00f3gica, un modelo conceptual que nos permite comprender como nos acercamos a las tecnolog\u00edas en la vida cotidiana. Tambi\u00e9n, analizaremos los l\u00edmites del concepto de tecnolog\u00eda.\n\nLa tecnolog\u00eda cambia y evoluciona, produciendo efectos en sus comunidades\n-En una perspectiva temporal, el cambio de los objetos y sistemas tecnol\u00f3gicos puede comprenderse como una evoluci\u00f3n tecnol\u00f3gica. En esta sesi\u00f3n nos centraremos en las perspectivas y efectos de estos desde ideas de evoluci\u00f3n e impacto tecnol\u00f3gico.\n\nLos origenes del a ciencia ficci\u00f3n son los origenes de la imaginaci\u00f3n del futuro\n-Este modulo es el primero donde analizaremos una expresi\u00f3n cultural que esta fuertemente relacionada con lo tecnol\u00f3gico: La ciencia Ficci\u00f3n. En un recorrido hist\u00f3rico revisaremos las primeras corrientes y obras que la constituyen, con el inter\u00e9s de comprender que el futuro que pensaban en el pasado, tiene en el presente muchos aspectos de realidad.\n\nCualquier tecnolog\u00eda suficientmente avanzada es indistinguible de la magia\n-Los imaginarios de la ciencia ficci\u00f3n se profundizan con los periodos de Edad de Oro y Edad de Plata. Ambos son claves en la construcci\u00f3n de nuestras ideas sobre el espacio, los robots, los futuros posibles y la tecnolog\u00eda. En este m\u00f3dulo se recorren los autores m\u00e1s reconocidos del g\u00e9nero y quienes m\u00e1s influencia han tenido en nuestra cultura tecnol\u00f3gica occidental.\n\nLa transformaci\u00f3n de la tecnolog\u00eda modifia los relatos de la ciencia ficci\u00f3n hoy\n-Los discursos cr\u00edticos de finales de la Guerra Fria tambi\u00e9n son parte de las discusiones y problem\u00e1ticas de la ciencia ficci\u00f3n, por lo tanto, hacen cambiar los paradigmas tecnol\u00f3gicos. En esta sesi\u00f3n presentamos los aspectos claves de la Nueva Ola, el Cyberpunk y el post-cyberpunk, reconociendo los aspectos comunes y centrales de los imaginarios de la ciencia ficci\u00f3n de fines de siglo XX e inicios de nuestro siglo. \u00bfSon siempre los mismos desaf\u00edos tecnol\u00f3gicos los desaf\u00edos del futuro?\n\nLos nuevos medios cambian la experiencia de vivir la ciencia ficci\u00f3n, el futuro y la tecnolog\u00eda\n-Este modulo, \u00faltimo en el tema de Ciencia ficci\u00f3n, nos hace observar otros medios m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de la literatura donde la ciencia ficci\u00f3n se manifiesta: El cine y el comic. El surgimiento de estos nuevos medios est\u00e1 fuertemente ligado al desarrollo cultural de la tecnolog\u00eda y a la creaci\u00f3n de mundos posibles a trav\u00e9s de la imagen fija y m\u00f3vil. Aqu\u00ed podemos reconstruir las tendencias de la ciencia ficci\u00f3n, as\u00ed como la evoluci\u00f3n tecnol\u00f3gica de ambos medios.\n\nLa obscolescencia, de la tecnolog\u00eda o de nuestra(s) cultura(s), es producida por la humanidad\n-Como todo, la tecnolog\u00eda presenta fin. Pero como objeto cultural, no es solo cuando se descompone, falla o se destruye, si no que cuando se desconfiguran los relatos comunes y los sentidos sociales de un determinado sistema u objeto tecnol\u00f3gico. En este modulo hablamos de obsolescencia, pero tambi\u00e9n de como el trabajo humano es desplazado por las maquinas.\n\nLa tecnolog\u00eda no es buena, no es mala... ni neutral\n-La tecnolog\u00eda siempre ha estado ligada a discusiones sobre sus usos y practicas. Estas son abordadas por la tecno\u00e9tica. En este modulo revisaremos algunos conceptos que nos permitan acercarnos a esta idea, as\u00ed como a la dimensi\u00f3n pol\u00edtica de la tecnolog\u00eda, de una manera m\u00e1s robusta y compleja.\n\nLa relaci\u00f3n tecnolog\u00eda-sociedad es una pregunta con muchas respuestas posibles\n-Hasta este momento hemos trabajado la tecnolog\u00eda desde procesos aislados y continuos, pero \u00bfExisten formas de comprender el cambio socio-t\u00e9cnico de forma m\u00e1s completa? Es aqu\u00ed donde las teor\u00edas tecnol\u00f3gicas surgen como una alternativa. En este modulo se introducen las ideas del determinismo tecnol\u00f3gico, la econom\u00eda evolucionista, la teor\u00eda actor-red, los grandes sistemas tecnol\u00f3gicos y la construcci\u00f3n social de la tecnolog\u00eda. Advertencia: Esta sesi\u00f3n puede ser algo densa.\n\nLa tecnolog\u00eda puede ser feminista, revolucionaria y emancipadora\n-Siguiendo la idea de teorizar sobre la tecnolog\u00eda, es necesario observar que hay modelos o propuestas que van m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de una perspectiva sociedad-tecnolog\u00eda, y que sosteniendose desde una perspectiva socialista, trabajan la dependencia y sumisi\u00f3n como aspectos centrales. El pensamiento latinoamericano en ciencia y tecnolog\u00eda y el feminismo tecnol\u00f3gico son descritos en este modulo, apuntando a redibujar como entendemos nuestras interacciones son sujetos y artefactos.\n\nLa tecnolog\u00eda es el producto de la innovaci\u00f3n de la humanidad\n-En este modulo analizaremos el acto del proceso tecnol\u00f3gico: La innovaci\u00f3n. Este concepto, tan utilizado contemporaneamente, tiene m\u00e1s de un significado, por lo que debemos distinguir sus usos y tradiciones. En este modulo se revisar\u00e1 tanto la innovaci\u00f3n como acci\u00f3n como proceso de desarrollo econ\u00f3mico, con la espectativa de quedarnos con lo mejor de los dos mundos.",

Aunque este MOOC ya se realiz\u00f3, si te inscribes podr\u00e1s acceder a los contenidos m\u00e1s importantes y a los v\u00eddeos. Sin embargo, no podr\u00e1s realizar ninguna de las actividades ni te podr\u00e1s certificar. Cuando est\u00e9 disponible una nueva edici\u00f3n podr\u00e1s inscribirte para que obtengas la experiencia completa de un MOOC de Mir\u00edadax.\n\nEste curso no universitario acerca al alumno al compositor Johannes Brahms y a sus \u00faltimas obras para piano. Para ello contaremos con la visi\u00f3n y los valiosos consejos de grandes maestros del instrumento: Dimitri Bashkirov, Emanuel Krasovsky, Vitaly Margulis, Pavel Gililov, Mihail Voskresensky, Joaqu\u00edn Ach\u00facarro, Galina Eguiazarova, Joaqu\u00edn Soriano... En el curso vamos a tener tanto material te\u00f3rico como pr\u00e1ctico estructurado en 10 m\u00f3dulos de una semana de duraci\u00f3n cada uno. El primer m\u00f3dulo es una introducci\u00f3n al contexto hist\u00f3rico del Romanticismo, los m\u00f3dulos 2 y 3 se centran ya en la figura de Brahms y a partir del 4\u00ba, nos metemos de lleno con la pieza elegida: el Intermezzo no. 2 en la menor del op. 116. El m\u00f3dulo 4 tiene un contenido m\u00e1s te\u00f3rico, pues se centra en el an\u00e1lisis de la pieza y en los principales problemas t\u00e9cnicos que vamos a encontrar, y los restantes, los m\u00f3dulos del 5 al 9 corresponden a las clases magistrales de cinco de los pedagogos del piano mencionados anteriormente.",

In this session we will get started using an IDE, and then download the current version of Maximilian. We\u2019ll be going through some of the examples, and building some really basic music software to get us started. Some of the most important things you will learn in this session include how simple waveforms can be used to create more complex ones, and how signals can be used to make sound, or to control sound, depending on how those signals are scaled.\nSession 2: Sound Synthesis And Control \nBuilding on the previous session's introduction, we will be learning more about waveforms and their construction, and looking at additive synthesis. After this we\u2019ll be exploring how we can use simple statements to make an efficient metronome object that can be used to make things happen. At the end of the session, you will have all built synthesizers in C++ and made them play things that sound like music.\nSession 3: Real-Time Recursive Filters, LFOs, And Sample Playback \nIn this session we will learn how to use Maximilian\u2019s built-in filters to create a subtractive synthesizer and an LFO, and get some insight into how these work. We will also learn how to load in a sample and play it back.\nSession 4: Building A Drum Machine/Sample Playback Device, Manipulating Samples, And Using Envelopes \nDuring the first half of the lesson we will be working to create a drum machine using sample players and sequencer skills from the previous session. Following this we will be looking at various ways of manipulating sample playback to create interesting effects, and learn how to use basic envelope generators to control parameters. We will also look at an advanced example demonstrating how to create a polyphonic music device.",

El \"Desing Thinking\" (DT) puede entenderse como una t\u00e9cnica de dise\u00f1o centrado en el usuario. Mediante la aplicaci\u00f3n de DT, el proceso de dise\u00f1o se divide en varias etapas principales: inspiraci\u00f3n, ideaci\u00f3n e implementaci\u00f3n.\n\nA lo largo de este curso aplicaremos la metodolog\u00eda de DT a la resoluci\u00f3n de un problema real y concreto, para encontrar soluciones u oportunidades que permitan resolver el problema planteado. Recorreremos las distintas fases del proceso de dise\u00f1o, para lo cual el alumno tendr\u00e1 que ponerse en contacto con los usuarios potenciales para entender sus necesidades, tendr\u00e1 que construir prototipos r\u00e1pidos y probar su validez, y tendr\u00e1 que iterar hasta obtener una soluci\u00f3n adecuada al problema planteado.",

        "overview": "On November 9, 2013 the devastating typhoon Haiyan hit the Phillipines, causing more than 5,000 deaths and destroying the homes and cities for millions. Natural disasters are happening more and more often due to climate change. We can\u2019t do much to stop them, but as architects we can help with the recovery and to build shelters that would withstand them.\nThe goal of this online course is to generate design ideas for resilient schools for the victims of Typhoon Haiyan and other natural disasters. The participants in this course will design schools, which could be implemented by the Department of Education and Architecture for Humanity in the Philippines. We will engage with a team of architects, planners, engineers, and social workers. After the course, the projects and instructions will be placed on the open source platform Open Online Architecture (OOArch.org), so anyone can download and use them.\nAn international jury will select the best projects, which will eventually be built. We\u2019ll have weekly lectures and daily discussions on our forum. A team of professors, consultants, and teaching assistants led by Prof. Ivan Shumkov will guide and assist all students in their work.\nLearning Outcomes\nStudents will learn about resilient architeture and how it can be used in communities in need. They will improve their design and collaboration skills. During the second week of the course, each student will design individual proposals and post them on the forum. All students will be publish their design proposals and ask others for feedback and help on their projects. They will form collaboration teams, which will work together on developing integral projects that include aspects of architectural design, engineering, social space, community development, economical feasibility, sustainability and resilience.",

        "overview": "A development of music industry and its systems was not an instantaneous, single event that can be attributed to one point in time, one idea, one person, or one institution. Its evolution, from a solely cultural phenomenon to a multifaceted commercial product, involved various social, technological, and legislative processes that defined its place in the society. Ultimately, in order to truly understand the new world of the music industry and its future direction, one must consider its progress and development stemming from those diverse processes.\n\nThis course explores and addresses those often neglected, but vital, issues and perspectives as it is maps out, clarifies, and analyses today\u2019s music industry structures, principles, and spectrum \u2013 the issues of not just the existing surface state, shape, and mechanics, but of deep root causes and origins. For, it is these original particles of the music industry\u2019s DNA, combined with all its adaptive mutations over time, that lead to true understanding of its present and allow a meaningful glimpse at its future.",

You\u2019ll also engage in a series of discussions and reflections with colleagues and peers across the globe. Upon completion of this course, we hope you\u2019ll return to your studio with confidence, a new curriculum, and a renewed approach to sharing with your students the joyful experience of making beautiful music.",

        "syllabus": "Beginning Stages\n-Welcome to Teaching the Violin and Viola: Creating a Healthy Foundation! We will begin by covering leading philosophies and pedagogical theories about teaching children the violin and viola. The beginning stages will cover the child\u2019s setup, posture and first left hand techniques.\n\nBow Arm and Hand\n-To introduce the use of the right hand, we start by creating a \u201cpinky house\u201d for the child\u2019s bow. We delve further into the violin setup and positioning through various creative exercises.\n\nPutting It All Together\n-Now we get to put it all together by slowly incorporating the different movements of the right and left hand through four different pieces.\n\nPieces in the Key of A Major\n-After good setup and posture have been established, we start teaching the fundamentals through elementary pieces in the key of A Major. We also get to learn our first scale!\n\nPlaying with the Whole Bow\n-To transition to using the full bow, we introduce the \u201cadult \u201c bow hold and a series of exercises to extend the bow stroke. Pieces include Long, Long Ago, O Come, Little Children, and Butterfly, Flutterby.\n\nPieces in the Key of D Major\n-We can now introduce the key of D Major. Students learn the D major scale along with pieces such as Bach Musette and Hushabye Lullaby.\n\nPieces in the Key of G Major\n-When we progress to the G Major scale and arpeggio, we start adding etudes and more advanced technical concepts. Pieces covered include Minuet and Happy Farmer.\n\nNote Reading, Vibrato, and the Group Class\n-To teach note reading, we will cover the best-practice teaching techniques for note reading and vibrato. We will also explore group teaching, group games, and group dynamics.\n\nFavorite Exercises for the Older Student\n-Now that our students are getting more advanced, we can begin to cover our favorite exercises for the older student. Exercises include \"Poof Bow\" and the \"Invisible Violin.\"\n\nThe Master Class\n-In our final segment, we will learn from top pedagogues Mimi Zweig and Roland and Almita Vamos in a master class setting.",

You\u2019ll also engage in a series of discussions and reflections with colleagues and peers across the globe. Upon completion of this course, we hope you\u2019ll return to your studio with confidence, a new curriculum, and a renewed approach to sharing with your students the joyful experience of making beautiful music.",

Make sure to read it right away and refer back to it when needed.\n\nPublic Art and Spatial Politics: Lectures, Guest Presentations, and Quiz\n-This lesson will lay out some basic definitions and examples of public practice and socially engaged art, especially as they relate to spatial politics. We will examine the critical role that such practices have had in relation to various forms of urbanism and social planning and consider the physical and symbolic mechanisms that separate the global and the local, the urban and the rural, the visible and the invisible, citizens and immigrants, settlers and refugees. The lecture and guest presentations will provide foundation and inspiration for students\u2019 own experiments with spatial politics.\n\nPublic Art and Spatial Politics: Projects and Peer Reviews\n-The prompt, lecture and guest presentations will provide the foundation and inspiration for students\u2019 own experiments with spatial politics. Students will need to choose one lesson to complete: The social method project or the worldwide flashmob project.\n\nFictions, Alternative Structures, and Mock-Institutions: Lectures, Guest Presentations, and Quiz\n-By definition, social art is a collective endeavor. It might seek to transform larger social structures and economies. Perhaps more modestly, it might offer some alternatives or simply confront immediate challenges. The production of an unusual, creative, or engaged collective body can be its final goal. In this lesson we will learn how socially engaged artists have used the guise or actual form of organizations and institutions such as churches, corporations, banks, government offices, and other social units as the very media of their work. This lesson\u2019s practical components will ask students to invent their own alternative social structures or fictional interventions.\n\nFictions, Alternative Structures, and Mock-Institutions: Projects and Peer Reviews\n-The prompt, lecture and guest presentations will provide foundation and inspiration for students\u2019 own experiments with spatial politics.\n\nExperimental Pedagogy: Lectures, Guest Presentations, and Quiz\n-Many socially engaged artists are invested in the communication of ideas through education or educational projects. From Freire and Boal to Judy Chicago and Miriam Shapiro\u2019s Womanhouse and the CalArts Feminist Art Program a brief review of experimental or radical pedagogy and its influence on art is hence the focus of this lesson. Using various technologies and social forms, some of these works set out to transform education from within. Others intentionally position themselves as self-organized platforms outside of institutions. Our focus will be on how the production of alternative communities of learning can challenge the hierarchies, professionalization, homogenization, and economy of current education systems. This week\u2019s practical components will invite students to rethink their relationship to education as they chose between small-scale socialization and massive collaboration.\n\nExperimental Pedagogy: Projects and Peer Reviews\n-The prompt, lecture and guest presentations will provide a foundation and inspiration for students\u2019 own experiments with spatial politics.",

Why should this surprise us? Almost none of us has ever been taught how to be inventive.\nThis course is based on an extraordinarily successful program that has been presented at over 70 top American universities. Over the next 5 weeks Dr. Roberta Ness, an internationally renowned physician-scientist and an expert in innovative thinking, provides proven techniques to expand your originality. The method she will teach you is described by the acronym PIG In MuD: Define the problem, identify frames, generate all possible alternatives, incubate, meld to your best ideas, and disseminate. Your mascot will be Eggbert, an uptight, risk-avoidant pig who will learn a thing or two along with you. Along with Eggbert, you will sharpen your powers of observation, making surprising associations, expanding assumptions, pulling questions apart, and thinking backwards. Solving real-world problems in business and science, you will hone your creative thinking skills. In a final group project, you will be amazed by how creative you have become. Since the top projects will be voted up onto the home page and visible to all collaborating companies, you may even come across unique career opportunities when you and your ideas are \u201cdiscovered.\u201d\nThe funding for this course was made possible by the UTHealth Innovation in Cancer Prevention Research Training Program (Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas grant #RP140103).

If you have a basic knowledge of music theory or if you have completed Developing Your Musicianship I, this course will continue to help you understand key musical concepts, enabling you to create and perform contemporary music. Taught by Berklee College of Music professor George W. Russell, Jr., the course includes four lessons that delve into the next level of harmony and ear training.\n\nThe course will introduce you to new key signatures, including minor tonalities, and how they are constructed. You will train your ear to hear minor intervals and 7th chords. You will learn how to build 7th chords, and how to build common chord progressions. You will also learn the major pentatonic scale and how to construct melodies using this scale.\n\nThe course culminates with an assignment that asks you to compose and perform an 8-measure composition using popular chord progressions and the Major pentatonic scale. Just like Developing Your Musicianship I, the course is designed to impart the joy of creating music and sharing it with others.",

Here we will cover all the details about the course and what you'll need to know to get the most out of your course experience.\n\nLesson 1\n-In this lesson, we will spend a little time reviewing the material from Developing Your Musicianship I. We will learn about the Key of F Major and its related minor key, D minor. We will also practice training our ears to hear minor 2nd and 3rd intervals and major and minor 7th chords.\n\nLesson 2\n-In this lesson, we will explore diatonic 7th chords in the key of G major and F major. We will learn four new popular chord progression using diatonic triads. We will continue to train our ears, reviewing the intervals and chords from the previous lesson while adding minor 6th and 7th intervals and the dominant 7th chord.\n\nLesson 3\n-In this lesson, we will learn about the key of G major. We will play with the popular chord progressions from the last lesson by adding the 7th. We will continue to train our ears, reviewing the intervals and chords from the previous two lessons while adding the tritone and the half diminished (or the minor 7 flat 5) chord.\n\nLesson 4\n-In this final lesson, we will explore the major pentatonic scale. We will also learn how to write a chord chart using the popular chord progressions from this course. We will continue to train our ears, reviewing all of the intervals and chords from the course.",

The whole discussion will be framed and applied to concrete managerial problems, including a discussion of the specific managerial tools that facilitate the application of a scientific approach to innovation management.\n\nTHEORY AND DATA FOR INNOVATION MANAGEMENT\n-We provide more details about the scientific approach and we introduce probabilities to understand how and why certain decisions lead to some outcomes instead of others and how to make better decisions. We also focus on how to formulate and test hypotheses in practice, and how to interpret these tests. We finally discuss how to design and run experiments.\nNB: some videos may contain a downloadable database; please, download it and follow the in-video instructions\n\nDATA ANALYSIS\n-We cover the basics of data analysis, beginning with the distinction between correlation and causality in the analysis of data. We also teach how to make predictions using regression analysis and link these methods to the scientific approach, showing what role these analyses play, how they help to make scientific decisions and why.\nWe complement this with real examples of companies using data to make innovation decisions. We close by discussing how to interpret these analyses and results critically to make sure we understand what we really learn from the analyses and when, how and why we should interpret our results cautiously and critically.\n\nADVANCED TOOLS FOR INNOVATION MANAGEMENT DECISIONS\n-This is s a more advanced part in which we discuss causality and provide the students with some broad exposure to big data and machine learning, and we discuss what they can do for managerial decisions.We provide a general wrap-up and conclusion of the course, including a discussion of when the scientific approach is most appropriate or has limitations. This helps to see when to apply it, or when to apply other approaches, including our own gut feelings.\n\nNB: some videos may contain a downloadable database; please, download it and follow the in-video instructions\n\nFINAL PROJECT",

        "syllabus": "Introduction\n-A science has laws and rules. But art has no laws or rules. In fact, art is about breaking the rules, to create wonderful new works. Innovation is an art, not a science; it is about breaking the rules intelligently, to create value through novel, useful ideas. The best way to learn the art of innovation, or indeed to learn any art, is from those who have mastered it at the highest level and are willing and able to share their wisdom. In this course, a master innovator, Dadi Perlmutter, shares with Coursera learners what he has learned during 34 years of world-changing innovation at Intel Corp., where he served until recently as Executive Vice President. Perlmutter summarizes over three decades of innovation in ten key lessons, recounted in conversation with Prof. Shlomo Maital. Our hope is that these ten lessons will significantly improve your chances of success as an entrepreneur. At the end of this module you will be able to analyze situations of failure and success, and to draw conclusions for future situations.\n\nStrategy, Action & Resistance\n- Many highly creative people never get beyond vaguely talking about their ideas. Don\u2019t be like them, Perlmutter counsels. Take action to implement at least some of your ideas. The bigger your idea, the more resistance you will likely encounter. Perlmutter explains how he overcame such resistance, in order to help you do the same. At the end of this module you will be able to define key features of your product or service in order to differentiate it. You will also be able to focus on key ideas in order to fight resistance.\n\nEcosystem, Team & Simplicity\n-Innovators and their innovations rarely stand alone. Most innovations are part of large complex ecosystems. Perlmutter counsels you to design your ecosystem to enhance your innovation and offers examples of how he himself did this with the Centrino chipset. He then discusses how innovators can build powerful, effective teams. At the end of this module you will be able to design an ecosystem and build a powerful and effective team. You will also be able to simplify a complex product or service.\n\nSummary & Final Assignment\n-We began by observing that innovation is about breaking the rules. Nonetheless, experience shows that there are some basic lessons that can be learned from long years of experience, lessons that can help young startup entrepreneurs improve their chances of ultimate success. We hope and trust that Coursera learners have integrated these ten lessons, adapted and expanded them to fit their needs and personalities, and will make them part of their personal toolbox as they set out to use their creativity to change the world. The capstone project, the fourth of four courses in this specialization, will help them learn how to do this.",

Because it is often relatively ignored, this module focuses entirely on the importance of affect in creativity. Beyond intellectually understanding this importance, the module requires you to become an active observer of what affects you, versus what does not, in your daily life. It also teaches you how to harness these experiences to get a creative advantage.\n\nModule 3: Shaping Your Creative Environment\n-In module 2, we saw how you can work on your internal experience to enhance your creative potential. In module 3, we focus on how you can shape your external environment to constrain the creative process in a beneficial way.\n\nModule 4: Introducing You to Step-by-Step Instructions\n-In our last module, we dug deeper into the concept of an environmental variable that received considerable attention in creativity research, and also clearly applied to the business world: the external guidance that you get during the creative process. While many different types of guidance exist, module 4 introduces you to a few examples that have been documented to show remarkable traction in business.",

        "overview": "The course will analyze major contemporary architectural ideas, ideologies, and projects in the context of both globalization and specific local contexts. We will trace the development of architecture since the early 90s by discussing the work of some of the most influential architects of our time. The critical reflection on contemporary topics will allow students to better understand the buildings and cities which we live in. When talking about the architectural protagonists of today, we will focus on their most recent work. Some references will be made to their earlier work, but the focus will be on how they adapt their thinking to current design tendencies. We will examine the evolution of their work and at the same time try to understand how they react to current challenges and opportunities in our profession and society.\nLEARNING OUTCOMES\nThe course will introduce participants to the contemporary architecture scene and allow them to position themselves into it. Students will acquire the essential skills for looking at, analyzing and understanding architecture. The final goal is to turn use architecture as a way to look at the places that we inhabit, an action for positive change, and a generator of a vision for making possible worlds.\nWORKLOAD",

These concepts are designed to encompass a wide range of acoustic phenomena within spatial and social experience.\n\n\nElements of Sound and Social Practices\n-This lesson expands on specific terms or \u2018sound elements\u2019 that include tuning, resonance, silence, improvisation, rhythm, synchronization, duration, and timbre. It also addresses traditional tools in sound production, from musical instruments to sampling, auto-tunes, and other more recent technologies. The module concludes by exploring the role of sound in specific non-musical social settings and practices, such as clapping, fan culture, sports, traffic jams, mass demonstrations, and more.\n\nProject: Playing with Sound Rules\n- The practical component of this section is optional, asking learners to choose a space with specific \u2018sound rules\u2019 and change or alter these rules through actual experimentation.\n\nNOTATION, HOW MUSIC TRAVELS & PUBLIC SPACE\n-This lesson begins by focusing on the relationship between experimental practices and scores or notation systems. It also examines how sound has been used and understood by artists in specific urban contexts, such as ports, train stations, and airports, as well as rural settings, including forests, gardens, and the wider landscape. We conclude with an examination of how sound and music travel, be it through the populations who produce it, or the objects and digital files that are used to record and share it.\n\nProject: Erase the Sound of a Space\n-The practical component is optional, inviting learners to \u2018erase a sound in space\u2019 through a range of possible strategies.\n\nLISTENING AS PRACTICE, GLOBAL FORMS & THE SOUND OF THE NET\n-This lesson provides an overview of the methods and ideas from different schools of listening. It also presents a critical examination of the term \u2018world music\u2019 and how it has evolved in relation to economic and cultural globalization. With this global perspective in mind, the concluding portions of our lectures are dedicated to acoustic experience and musical experimentation on the net, the radio, cellular networks, and various social media, including all of the glitches, accidents, and failures we associate with these platforms.\n\nProject: Experiment with Failure\n-The practical component of this module is optional, asking learners to produce their own experiment with media and technical failure.\n\nOpen Project\n-This module is optional and only for those who wish to put what they learned from the course into one final project that is more open and ambitious in scale. Two options are given for this, one being your most ambitious project, and the other based on the creation and use of your own musical instruments.",

        "syllabus": "Week 1: The Simplest Games\n-This week we start at the beginning: what are the principles of very simple games, like Hangman and tic-tac-toe? How do these games work? Why do people play them? What are the elements that define games and the gaming experience? And finally, what do games have in common with each other, and what sets them apart? In addition to covering the basics and ground rules for this course, we'll conclude this week with a very simple, low-tech assignment: create a game on a single sheet of paper.\n\nWeek 2: Rules and Discovery\n-How does a player learn the mechanics of your game? How do they learn anything about your game? This week we will talk about the rules that define gameplay, and how those rules are communicated to your players. We also discuss the way rules are bent and broken by players.\n\nWeek 3: Tell a Story\n-How does narrative drive a player to start playing your game? Or to finish it? This week we'll look at some of the ways you can make your game more compelling with story, and discuss some of the ways story can drive gameplay forward, or enable a player to make their own way through it.\n\nWeek 4: The Friend and the Enemy\n-What purpose does an enemy serve in a game? What effect does a second player have on two-player games? Can a game work without an adversary or a final goal? We'll address all of those questions in this last week of the class, and work towards finalizing your board game project with characters.",

We give a short introduction to design innovation and review the process that design innovation projects typically follow. The module also features interviews with industry experts about their views on what design innovation is and how it is applied in industry.\n\nDesign thinking\n-This module provides you with an understanding of the first step in any design innovation project, which we refer to as design thinking. We discuss its role in the human-centred design process and how it relates to innovation. The module will also examine some of the tools used to collect data about users and customers. Industry experts explain the role of this step and the methods they use through concrete case studies.\n\nDesign making\n-In this module, we look at the design making part of the process. In design making, user or customer data is turned into concepts, prototypes and minimum viable products, which can be used to gain initial feedback about ideas. Industry experts discuss the importance of ideation and prototyping in the design industry.\n\nDesign breaking\n-This module looks at the value of evaluating designs, referred to as the design breaking part of a design innovation process. We explain some methods for evaluating design solutions, introduce fundamental design principles and see how designers are applying these methods in industry design innovation projects.\n\nRepeating design\n-This module focuses on the very important step in the design process of repeating, or iteration, and its role in design innovation. We also provide a summary of all the topics covered in the course and take you through the design process with a design research project. Industry experts share their insights and tips about working in the design industry.",

        "overview": "Architecture engages a culture\u2019s deepest social values and expresses them in material, aesthetic form. This course will teach you how to understand architecture as both cultural expression and technical achievement. Vivid analyses of exemplary buildings, and hands-on exercises in drawing and modeling, will bring you closer to the work of architects and historians.\n\nThe first part of the course introduces the idea of the architectural imagination. Perspective drawing and architectural typology are explored and you will be introduced to some of the challenges in writing architectural history.\n\nThen we address technology as a component of architecture. You will discover ways that innovative technology can enable and promote new aesthetic experiences, or disrupt age-old traditions. Technological advances changed what could be built, and even what could even be thought of as architecture.\n\nFinally, we'll confront architecture\u2019s complex relationship to its social and historical contexts and its audiences, achievements, and aspirations. You will learn about architecture\u2019s power of representation and see how it can produce collective meaning and memory.\n\nArchitecture is one of the most complexly negotiated and globally recognized cultural practices, both as an academic subject and a professional career. Its production involves all of the technical, aesthetic, political, and economic issues at play within a given society. Join us as we examine how architecture engages, mediates, and expresses a culture\u2019s complex aspirations.",

The fact that most of us have some sort of device that captures images in very high quality has empowered us to be able to document our own world.

How do you focus on telling other people\u2019s stories?\nBy studying the humanistic tradition towards photography with deep roots in the early 20th century, students will document the history of photojournalism and understand how this universal language speaks for itself despite all the technological aspects.\n ",

In this course, students will learn how to study games and engage in informed discussions about them. Ultimately, this course is about understanding the literacy of video games.\n\nUnderstanding Video Games was created with the help of world renowned video game developer, BioWare Corp, located in Edmonton, Alberta.\n\nThe three main parts of the course are:\n\n1) developing the terminology that enables us to talk about video games;\n\n2) exploring how these terms are used in theoretical frameworks to interpret games, and;\n\n3) turning these theories toward cultural aspects of games in order to understand how the medium has impacted society. One of the most important insights students will gain from the course will be an understanding of the interplay between video game designers, players and the games themselves.",

I believe anyone can learn Music Theory - and cost shouldn't be a barrier.\nMy approach to music theory is to minimize the memorization. Most of these concepts you can learn by just understanding why chords behave in certain ways. Once you understand those concepts, you can find any scale, key, or chord that exists.

The learning process becomes relaxed and allows the complex concepts to get absorbed easily. My only regret is not taking this course earlier.&quot; - &lt;/em&gt;M. Shah&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u21e2  &lt;em&gt;&quot;Great for everyone without any knowledge so far. I bought all three parts... It&#039;s the best investment in leveling up my skills so far..&quot; &lt;/em&gt;- Z. Palce&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u21e2  &lt;em&gt;&quot;Excellent explanations! No more or less than what is needed.&quot; - A. T\u00f3th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u21e2  &lt;em&gt;&quot;VERY COOL. I&#039;ve waiting for years to see a good video course, now I don&#039;t have to wait anymore. Thank You!&quot; - &lt;/em&gt;Jeffrey Koury&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u21e2&lt;em&gt;  &quot;I am learning LOTS! And I really like having the worksheets!&quot; -&lt;/em&gt; A.

Why are ground-breaking artists so often historically-minded (and yet tend to break all the rules of conventional history-telling)? How do animators themselves \u201cwrite\u201d the largely unwritten history of their art through quotation, transposition and mash-ups? Why should contemporary gamers look at classical painting anyway? \nThis course will combine short video lectures/interviews and interactive quizzes with independent, peer-reviewed sketchbook and field work (suggested visits to local museums, film viewings, etc.) It is intended to give the student a background in a wide range of visual practices and a greater familiarity with techniques of historical analysis. It will help to build skills in visual analysis, and will also provide insight into the creative culture of CalArts, where a certain portion of these art histories have been made in the first place.",

We are thrilled that you have joined us for Part 5 of Exploring Beethoven's Piano Sonatas course, taught by Jonathan Biss, Chair of Piano Studies at the Curtis Institute of Music. Jonathan is recognized as a world-renown concert artist and musical thinker. This course is Part 5 of the existing series called Exploring Beethoven\u2019s Piano Sonatas. As with all sections of this course, Part 5 contains new and separate sets of lectures. Specifically, we will dive into Beethoven's Piano Sonata Op. 27, No. 1; Sonata Op. 31, No. 1; Hammerklavier, Op. 106, to which there are two dedicated lectures for this monumental work. It is important to remind you that it is not necessary to have taken the previous Exploring Beethoven's Piano Sonatas courses, in order to enroll in this one. We think you will be perfectly comfortable to start learning with Part 5 if you wish and continue backwards. Between these courses, there exists a large amount of additional resources and learning that might be helpful as you embark on Part 5. And of course, we strongly encourage you to take Parts 1, 2, 3 and 4, if you have not yet. In the meantime, have a terrific time taking this class and Part 5 of Exploring Beethoven\u2019s Piano Sonatas.\n\nOp. 27, No. 1\n\nOp. 31, No. 1\n\nOp. 106: Hammerklavier (Part 1)\n\nOp. 106: Hammerklavier (Part 2)\n\nYour Thoughts Welcome",

En este primer m\u00f3dulo discutiremos los principios generales de los movimientos de software libre, c\u00f3digo abierto y cultura libre, y a partir de ello generamos una reflexi\u00f3n colectiva sobre la utilidad que estos principios pueden tener en el \u00e1mbito de la m\u00fasica y la creaci\u00f3n art\u00edstica.\n\nDe la creatividad compartida al arte colaborativo\n-Bienvenidas y bienvenidos. En este segundo m\u00f3dulo seguiremos discutiendo temas relacionados con la cultura libre. De manera espec\u00edfica, hablaremos del impacto que el internet y las tecnolog\u00edas digitales han tenido para el \u00e1mbito de la producci\u00f3n art\u00edstica y cultural. Adem\u00e1s, hablaremos de modelos permisivos de licenciamiento autoral, y llevaremos todo esto a una discusi\u00f3n sobre la relaci\u00f3n de la cultura libre con el arte colaborativo.\n\nAproximaciones est\u00e9ticas a la m\u00fasica colaborativa\n-Hola. En este tercer m\u00f3dulo revisaremos distintas maneras de aproximarse a la m\u00fasica colaborativa desde una perspectiva de cultura libre. Hablaremos de diversos proyectos y de propuestas est\u00e9ticas como el live coding, la m\u00fasica en red y la m\u00fasica remix.\n\nHerramientas para la colaboraci\u00f3n musical\n-Bienvenidas y bienvenidos.

Whether you are an active musician, an aspiring musician, or an aspiring music manager or agent - this class is perfect for you.\nFor years I've been teaching Music Theory in the college classroom. These classes I'm making for Udemy use the same syllabus I've used in my college classes for years, at a fraction of the cost. I believe anyone can learn Music Theory - and cost shouldn't be a barrier.\nMy approach to music theory is to minimize the memorization. Most of these concepts you can learn by just understanding why chords behave in certain ways. Once you understand those concepts, you can find any scale, key, or chord that exists. Even invent your own. If you've tried to learn music theory before, or if you are just starting out - this series of courses is the perfect fit.\nDr. Allen is a professional musician, top-rated Udemy instructor, and university professor.

The learning process becomes relaxed and allows the complex concepts to get obsorbed easily. My only regret is not taking this course earlier.&quot; - &lt;/em&gt;M. Shah&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u21e2  &lt;em&gt;&quot;Great for everyone without any knowledge so far. I bought all three parts... It&#039;s the best investment in leveling up my skills so far..&quot; &lt;/em&gt;- Z. Palce&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u21e2  &lt;em&gt;&quot;Excellent explanations! No more or less than what is needed.&quot; - A. T\u00f3th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u21e2  &lt;em&gt;&quot;VERY COOL. I&#039;ve waiting for years to see a good video course, now I don&#039;t have to wait anymore. Thank You!&quot; - &lt;/em&gt;Jeffrey Koury&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u21e2&lt;em&gt;  &quot;I am learning LOTS! And I really like having the worksheets!&quot; -&lt;/em&gt; A. Deichsel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u21e2 &lt;em&gt; &quot;The basics explained very clearly - loads of really useful tips!&quot;&lt;/em&gt; - J. Pook&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u21e2  &lt;em&gt;&quot;Jason is really quick and great with questions, always a great resource for an online class!&quot; M.

        "syllabus": "Welcome and Course Overview\n-Welcome to the course! Here are some helpful resources to guide you through this course.\n\nDirect Manipulation and Representations\n-Our lecture videos in this module begin with the major innovation of the graphical interface: enabling people to perform input directly on top of output. This directness makes interfaces easier to learn because it enables people to recognize familiar elements. And continuous feedback makes interfaces easier to use, encourages exploration, and prevents errors. To illustrate the benefits of direct manipulation in real interfaces, the videos provide several examples of both particular designs and interface styles. I find that's a lot more useful than just stating abstract principles. Now is a good time to remind everyone that I am not endorsing (or rejecting) any particular product, organization, or person. What I am doing: real people in the real world make real design decisions -- you can learn from this -- and in this course I'll discuss these concrete examples so you can gain real knowledge. The rest of the videos will cover topics related to the importance of representations, such as understanding a user's mental model and helping people to distribute cognition. I will show some examples of how representational differences can impact performance. As you watch these videos, think about how you have arranged or lamented representations in your everyday life. Maybe you put your keys by the door, sunglasses on your hat, or a post-it on your laptop? You'll get a chance to delve into these examples in the assignment.\n\nVisual Design and Information Design\n-So far, many examples in our videos have been physical. I like physical examples because they\u2019re often easier to understand, and they durably express fundamental principles. Equipped with those fundamentals, we'll now focus more on concrete issues in interaction design to help you flesh out your interactive prototypes. This module\u2019s videos introduce visual and information design. These are the nuts and bolts of user interfaces: scale, contrast, pattern, shape, color, typography, and layout. What I hope you'll take away from these lectures is a newfound appreciation for how subtle changes in this visual variables can powerfully impact people's experience of documents and interfaces. Dive into the first visual design lecture here. Visual design organizes the world of information. As this module\u2019s lectures show, that visual organization provides important cues, yet the structure itself is often invisible.\n\nDesigning Experiments\n-After you\u2019ve made a design, how do you know whether it is good? Or if your team has a couple ideas it is considering, how do you know which one is better? Rather than arguing, throwing chairs, or playing rochambeau, we suggest getting your designs in front of real users to see how well they actually work. To enable you to do this, our final module of lectures will introduce you to designing, running, and analyzing experiments. Testing your ideas with people and using what you learn to make them better can often mean the difference between a flop and a hit. Usability testing also gives you a chance to flex your rapid prototyping muscles. Build several interfaces quickly, try them out with people, and use what you learn to revise them. Through repeated iteration and testing, you can end up with a wonderfully polished interface. For me, the most exhilarating aspect of running experiments is the element of surprise. Nearly every time my students, colleagues, and I run a study, we learn something that we never even thought to think of. Sometimes, it's a roadblock or bug. Other times, it's an unexpected new use of a system -- many great startups have emerged out of finding unexpected new uses for technology. Either way, it'll give you new fodder for design. As in the prototyping lectures, the evaluation lectures emphasize comparison -- testing multiple ideas. In many ways, design is choice, and comparing multiple interfaces helps you make good choices.

        "overview": "In this course, critique is defined as a detailed, objective analysis of a work of graphic design and its effectiveness. Critique is an integral part of the making process for designers: it\u2019s not just how we determine if a work of design is or is not successful, it\u2019s how we move our work forward. Critique is also where other voices and opinions can be brought into the design process.\n\nThis course will introduce a lexicon (or vocabulary) in order for you to demonstrate clearer and more considered ways of talking about graphic design in the context of critique. Through this lexicon and a provided Critique Framework, we will model and then practice objectively describing how well a work of design functions based on specific, clearly articulated criteria. By refining this skill, you will enhance your ability to communicate about design with peers, colleagues, and clients.\n\nThis course is essential to anyone looking to develop and refine a critical vocabulary around talking about art and design, such as:\n- practicing graphic designers at all levels\n- future and current students of art or design programs\n- teachers teaching visual art, design, or related subjects\n- any stakeholder in a design project that needs to communicate effectively with designers on their team.\n\nThis course is recommended to learners enrolled in either the Graphic Design Specialization or UI/UX Design Specialization on Coursera to further develop their skills in graphic design. You may take this course before, during, or after completing either Specialization.\n\nNote this is not an art appreciation course for a general audience. While no prior experience is required to begin, the knowledge and skills taught in this course is useful only if you have some relationship to design in a professional context, i.e., practicing, studying, or teaching design, or working directly with designers.\n\nNo specific software or tools are required to complete this course.",

        "syllabus": "Week 1: Course Orientation and Overview\n\nWeek 1: Audience/Context/Culture\n-This module provides an introduction to the larger ideas and cultural discussions that graphic design work inhabits, and some terms and ideas used within graphic design. We won't be covering a comprehensive dictionary of graphic design terms, but rather introducing a functional language used in the discussion of graphic design in a critique context. We will also discuss and analyze specific works of design and how they relate to the larger cultural context in which design operates, and why this is important. We will also learn about critique culture, and the importance of analyzing work based on subjective criteria rather than personal taste or subjective opinions.\n\nWeek 2: Basics of Form\n-In this module we will introduce key concepts and terms used in the critique of visual form in design work. We will cover basic terms used in the discussion of visual contrast, composition, and hierarchy. We will also discuss how to establish a vocabulary for the evaluation of visual form, and use that vocabulary in conjunction with the designer\u2019s intention and the function of the work to build a framework to structure critique.\n\nWeek 3: Meaning and Concept\n-In this module we will focus on ways to describe and evaluate meaning in works of visual design. Using connotation and denotation as a foundation, the lessons in this module explain a range of approaches for creating meaning, from visual metaphor to cliche and parody. By building cultural literacy and developing research skills, we will practice identifying themes in design work and interpreting design concepts.\n\nWeek 4: Synthesis: Critique and Effective Design\n-In this final module, you will synthesize all of the skills you have acquired in the previous modules into a structured critique of graphic design work. As you will see, this module is weighted much more heavily toward assessment and practice than previous modules. Assessing the success of a finished piece of design is difficult because there are so many variables to consider at the same time. You have learned the basic lexicon and syntax for talking about design. Now is the time to put all of these skills together to talk about a piece of design in a holistic and effective way.",

If you listen to music or play music by ear, and you want to know more about how music is organized and notated, this course is for you.\n\nBy the end of the course, you should know all major and minor keys, how to read and write in treble and bass clef using standard meters and rhythmic values, and how to notate and harmonize a simple melody. This course can serve as a stand-alone basic music theory course, or it can be a springboard to more advanced theory and composition courses.\n\nYour instructor is Bruce Taggart, Associate Professor of Music Theory at Michigan State University, in the College of Music, where he has taught undergraduate and graduate music theory since 1996.",

        "syllabus": "Introduction\n\nHeroes\n-Wearing certain garments can inspire heroic transformations, while heroes can elevate everyday clothing to iconic status. In this module, you will discover the relationship between aspiration, achievement, adulation, and attire through a wide range of heroes\u2014and even imagine yourself as a space hero in the future.\n\nSilhouettes\n-When we put on clothes, we change the shape and outline of our bodies\u2014sometimes profoundly. The silhouettes we adopt are determined by everything from shifting trends in fashion to what looks and feels good. This week, we explore how clothes shape the body and how cultural constructions of the body shape clothes.\n\nCoutures\n-The French word couture means \"dressmaking\" or \"sewing,\u201d and often refers to one-of-a-kind, primarily handmade garments intended for a specific individual. This module approaches couture from a broader perspective, exploring the complex processes\u2014from traditional handcrafting to the use of new technologies\u2014that go into the making of high-end and everyday garments.\n\nLifecycle\n-This module examines the lifecycle of garments, an often overlooked aspect of fashion that many individuals and companies are addressing with growing urgency. How do garments begin, how do they end, and how does the cycle of production, consumption, and disposal impact the world?\n\nModesty\n-Modesty has many varied expressions that can be informed by social, religious, or political identifications, as well as by personal choice. But whether covered up or exposed, our bodies are often battlegrounds for continually shifting societal claims around morality, agency, and etiquette.\n\nExpression\n-What we wear and how we wear it can communicate messages, create group identification, borrow and remake existing styles, or subvert a garment\u2019s traditional associations. While choosing and wearing clothes is an act of personal expression, it is also a response to many of the topics addressed in the preceding weeks of this course. In this final week, we look at the ways in which clothing allows us to feel connected to others and to stand out.",

        "syllabus": "An Introduction to Rehearsing\n-This week, Module 1, we\u2019ll discuss basic philosophical issues such as: What we do in rehearsals, what skills are needed, and the idea of the conductor as \u201cthe composer\u2019s advocate.\u201d I will also introduce the concept of Macro-Micro-Macro, which serves as the overarching principle of rehearsals. Then we will move on to basic conducting technique.\n\nCommunicating with the Ensemble\n-Module 2 begins with a discussion about repertoire: how to define quality music and how to choose a balanced, musically nourishing program. Building on the topics of Module 1, this week\u2019s conducting technique videos focus on the grammar for starting and stopping pieces. In the rehearsal technique videos, the overarching topic is how to communicate with the ensemble to convey musical intent. Essentially, the idea is to give musical instruction, but there are a range of strategies we must master to be effective in all situations.This week introduces those strategies and organizes them according to modes of instruction, including performance technique, adjectives, analogy, and modeling.\n\nIntroducing the Rehearsal Toolkit\n-Week 3\u2019s material begins with more left hand technique, expanding on the concepts introduced in Module 2 and continuing with gestures to show dynamics. The section on rehearsal technique begins with an explanation of the \u2018Rehearsal Toolkit,\u201d a collection of ideas, or \u201ctools,\u201d each designed to fix a musical issue. Rehearsal tools are meant to supplement the modes of instruction that were discussed last week. In other words, in addition to using direct vocabulary, modeling, and metaphor and analogy, these tools can elicit musical responses when gesture and words fail. A caveat: all of these approaches depend on the musicians having the technique required to perform the repertoire. This may seem obvious, but the fanciest baton twirl and colorful analogy are meaningless to help, say, a trumpeter, perform staccato if he does not tongue properly and employ good embouchure. Fundamentals must be taught, either in or out of the rehearsal, and the appropriate method depends on the level and age of the musician in the ensemble.Module 3 concludes with multi-purpose tools, including singing and \u201cbopping.\u201d These are the Swiss-Army knives of rehearsal technique, each useful for a variety of issues, from articulation to balance to rhythm. As you acquire the tools discussed in this module, also consider what else you can put in your toolbox. What techniques do you currently use? What tools can you borrow from other musicians? The more options we have in rehearsal the more likely we will be to solve a musical problem.\n\nArticulation, Balance, and Tone\n-Module 4 begins with perhaps the most crucial task a conductor undertakes: score study. Score study is the umbrella term for the process of thoroughly learning a score-- not just knowing how to sing the melody or memorizing phrases and meters--but learning every aspect of the music that may come to bear on our ability to interpret, conduct, rehearse, and perform it. Unlike many grammatical aspects of conducting, score study is a time-consuming, immersive activity for which it is normal to develop one\u2019s own process, assuming the end result is a deep understanding of the work.\n\nAfter score study, Module 4 moves back to the grammar of conducting, particularly technique for conducting articulations. Please note that this week also contains a very brief introduction to the three types of fermatas. In Module 5 we\u2019ll cover them in detail. These are topics for which regular practice and self-evaluation will be necessary to develop gestures that are clear to the ensemble and second-nature to the conductor.\n\nFinally, we will return to \u201cThe Rehearsal Toolkit\u201d and explore strategies for rehearsing articulation, balance, and tone. This final topic includes a video on using the piano to demonstrate harmonies and other musical features to the ensemble. Particularly in educational settings, it is important for the conductor to do more than treat the ensemble as his personal musical instrument. Instead, find opportunities to lead ensembles to an understanding of the music it is performing, a goal that only score study makes possible.\n\nPhrasing\n-Module 5 begins with a discussion about score marking, a topic that is controversial by some ways of thinking. One school of thought suggests that scores should never be marked with cues and other information, since doing so reflects a deficit in score study on the piece. Another school believes that judicious marking enhances our efficiency in rehearsal and allows for better connection with the ensemble. This module also includes detailed explanations of the three types of fermatas that were introduced in Module 4: caesura, release-in-tempo, and continuation. It is worth spending extra time on these techniques, as the skills involved in preparing, sustaining, and releasing each one apply to a variety of conducting situations, including cues, rubato, and accompanimental conducting. For rehearsal strategies and the rehearsal toolkit our topics are phrasing and dynamics. As with many other topics in this class we can only touch the surface in terms of depth, but I hope there will be a few ideas to begin filling your rehearsal toolkit.\n\nAccompanimental Conducting and Intonation\n-Module 6 (our final week!) begins with a brief discussion about planning rehearsals, moves to techniques for accompanimental conducting, and then dips into the Rehearsal Toolkit for intonation strategies. The intonation section includes an introduction to overtones, harmonics, and temperaments. These are acoustic concepts for which at least a basic understanding is useful for knowing how to achieve good pitch. It\u2019s a fascinating topic, and a great example of how we can apply science to art. The final few videos cover a miscellanea of rehearsal topics, including protecting one\u2019s ears, the use of a podium, and set-up issues.",

        "overview": "This first course in the two-part program, Generative Art and Computational Creativity, proposes an introduction and overview of the history and practice of generative arts and computational creativity with an emphasis on the formal paradigms and algorithms used for generation. The full program will be taught by Associate Professor from the School of Interactive Arts and Technology at Simon Fraser University and multi-disciplinary researcher, Philippe Pasquier.\nOn the technical side, we will study core techniques from mathematics, artificial intelligence, and artificial life that are used by artists, designers and musicians across the creative industry. We will start with processes involving chance operations, chaos theory and fractals and move on to see how stochastic processes, and rule-based approaches can be used to explore creative spaces. We will study agents and multi-agent systems and delve into cellular automata, and virtual ecosystems to explore their potential to create novel and valuable artifacts and aesthetic experiences.\nThe presentation is illustrated by numerous examples from past and current productions across creative practices such as visual art, new media, music, poetry, literature, performing arts, design, architecture, games, robot-art, bio-art and net-art. Students get to practice these algorithms first hand and develop new generative pieces through assignments and projects in MAX. Finally, the course addresses relevant philosophical, and societal debates associated with the automation of creative tasks.",

        "syllabus": " Session 1: Introduction and Ontology of Generative Art (February 1, 2016)\nIn this session, we define generative art and computational creativity and establish a typology of generative systems based on levels of autonomy and agency.\nSession 2: History of Generative Art (from pre-history to the 80s) (February 2, 2016)\nGenerative art is nothing new, and this session goes through the history of the field from pre-history to the 80s\nSession 3: Generative Art and Text (February 2, 2016)\nThis session focuses on generative processes deployed in literature, poetry and other written forms.\nSession 4: Generative Music (February 2, 2016)\nIn this session, algorithms used for the generation of both notated and interpreted music are reviewed.\nSession 5: Generative Visual Art, Video, and Film (February 2, 2016)\nThis session explores the various processes deployed to date in the field of static and moving images.\nSession 6: Generative Sculpture, Design, and Architecture (February 2, 2016)\n3D and tangible realizations based on generative systems are reviewed in this session.\nSession 7: Generative Art and Performance, Dance, Theatre, and Circus (February 2, 2016)\nThis session is exploring the various uses of generative systems in performative disciplines.\nSession 8: Generative Art and Games (February 2, 2016)\nThis session reviews how generative algorithms are used in video games from procedural level generation to computational narratives and automatic character design.\nSession 9: Generative Art, Robotics, bio-Art and Web Art (February 2, 2016)\nThis session introduces generative systems deployed in disciplines that did not exist before the computerization of our societies, such as robotics, Web Art, Virtual Reality, biotech-based art.\nSession 10: Computer-assisted Creativity (February 2, 2016)\nThis session, defines the main concepts and approaches used in systems that are designed to collaborate with humans in their creative tasks.\nSession 11: Valuation and Evaluation of Generative Art (February 2, 2016)\nIn this session, we explore the methodologies that can be used to evaluate how successful a given generative system is. Can a generative system be as good, or sometimes better than humans at their specific task?\nSession 12: Generative Art, Authorship and Societal Perspectives (February 2, 2016)\nThis session concludes the course by deepening our understanding of the possible applications and implications of generative art. We address ethical, and philosophical concerns that can be raised by generative systems. What does developing or using a generative system means in terms of authorship and creativity",

        "overview": "Every mobile app gives you something. It could be not only something tangible like the pair of jeans you've ordered using the app but also a piece of work like waking you up in the morning. It could be a feeling, for instance, a feeling of enjoyment obtained from watching a video clip or a feeling of closeness flashed out after receiving an old photo from a loving person via some instant messenger. That \"something\" is actually the reason why you use the app, it is the heart of the product, and in this course we will not talk about it. Surprised? You shouldn\u2019t be. There are always two sides of a coin. There should be a person who makes that \"something\" accessible. It is astonishingly important because the use of the product loses its meaning if users can\u2019t get what they want.\n\nThe main objective of the course is to teach you to shape mobile products and services for people\u2019s use. To do that, you\u2019ll need to learn:\n- Interaction design activities and their place in the whole product design process\n- User research methods with a focus on the qualitative ones\n- Usability inspection and empirical usability evaluation methods\n- The process of design creation and best practices from interaction design, information architecture and visual design fields of study with a focus on the former\nInterfaces of handheld devices and tablets are in the spotlight. However, the processes and techniques covered by the course can be successfully applied to design interactions with mobile web apps and wearables. It should be noted that this course does not cover topics such as design management and mobile development, and it will as well not teach you how to use wireframing and prototyping tools.\n\nWhat makes the course unique is a focus on the way of thinking during a design process, the representation of a designer\u2019s decisions in the form of design questions that make the continuous reflection on the design process possible and leads to the growth of the number of proposed design alternatives. The second unique thing about this course is a focus on the explanation of the concept of usability problems, and the processes of discovering and analysing them.\n\nUpon completion of the course, you will be able to:\n- Improve designs by eliminating different kinds of interaction problems\n- Design huge chunks of user interfaces in the case of adding a new feature to a product\n- Redesign a complete app by a given set of functions (e.g., extending an existing product to a new platform)\n\nThe practical part of the course will require you to discover and eliminate interaction problems of a chosen mobile app. You will go through running guerrilla usability study, analysing gathered data, and making evidence-based design changes, which will enable you to create your first case study.\n\nThis course was designed for those who are involved in creating digital interactive products (not necessarily for mobile) but do not have considerable experience in interaction design. If you are a UX professional in a junior position, a developer, manager or visual designer, this class is for you. This is not an introductory level course, so if you are new to the field, we recommend you take the \u201cIntroduction to User Experience Design\u201d course from Georgia Institute of Technology before taking this one. Also, parts of this course such as the aforementioned process of design creation and approach to usability inspection can be useful for experienced designers.\n\nDo you have technical problems?

        "syllabus": "WEEK 1: Mobile Interaction Design: An introduction\n-The first week is introductory in nature. It examines the place of interaction design activities in the whole product design process as well as essential concepts such as usability and the context of use that you need to comprehend before proceeding to the next week. At the end of this week, you\u2019ll also get acquainted with such thing as design-informing models and learn how to create personas that I recommend you to do while working on your practical task.\n\nWEEK 2: User Research\n-This week gives you the whole idea of the methods used for studying the context of use. It also examines how to look for participants in detail, plan and conduct Cooper's ethnographic interviews and qualitative data analysis. This knowledge will enable you to drill down into the usage context of the mobile app you\u2019ve chosen.\n\nWEEK 3: Usability Inspection Methods & Intro to Usability Evaluation\n-The third week covers the overview of usability evaluation methods, the examination of essential usability evaluation concepts and models such as user interface idioms, Norman\u2019s Stages-of-action model, usability problems and so on, as well as detailed discussion of several usability inspection methods including Cognitive walkthrough, Scenario-based walkthrough, and design reviews. At the end of this week, you\u2019ll learn how to make sense of data gathered through formative usability evaluation methods. Here you can find the first graded peer-review assignment dedicated to forming recruitment criteria for guerrilla usability tests you\u2019ll conduct later.\n\nWEEK 4: Guerrilla Usability Testing & Field Visits\n-This week is solely dedicated to two methods: Guerrilla usability testing and field visits aimed at evaluating usability. It examines how to plan and conduct them in detail. You\u2019ll apply the knowledge acquired through this week to develop a test plan and submit it as a part of the second graded peer-review assignment.\n\nWEEK 5: The Process of Design Creation\n-The process of design creation is a structured way to come up with as many interaction design solutions as possible which are designed to support your creativity. In combination with the appropriate way of selecting among the solutions examined in this week too, the process enables you to find the most usable solutions within existing constraints. This week examines the process of design creation and all related topics in detail.\n\nWEEK 6: Accumulated Design Knowledge & Task Redesign\n-Designers base their solutions on design decisions already made by their fellow designers. This week is dedicated to the discussion of the knowledge that is already there and where to find it. In this week you\u2019ll also learn basic design principles and examine the aspect that is very important for mobile interaction design: How to redesign user tasks. This week you will need to conduct the guerrilla usability testing according to the plan you have and record all its sessions. Some of these recordings may be submitted as part of the optional peer-review assignment. This will allow you to get feedback on how you moderated the study.\n\nWEEK 7: Navigation Design & Design Rationale\n-The organisation of a mobile user interface and navigation between its parts is a crucial aspect of mobile interaction design. The first part of this week examines different iOS and Android navigational patterns and their application in real world context. At the end of this week, you\u2019ll learn how to write design rationale, an explicit justification of decisions behind an interaction design. This knowledge will enable you to complete the last graded peer-review assignment in one of the following weeks.\n\nWEEK 8: Intro to Visual Design\n-Designing aesthetically pleasant user interfaces is no less important than designing usable interfaces. This week is solely dedicated to the former. You\u2019ll learn how to choose and customise types, apply different types of colour schemes, select and use images, create a sign and design a harmonious layout of the mobile screen. Here you can find the peer-review assignment dedicated to the analysis of data gathered through guerrilla usability testing.\n\nWEEK 9: Catch Up Week\n-This week has no theoretical material and is designed to give you time to work on your practical task.\n\nWEEK 10: Final Week\n-This week includes the last graded peer-review assignment that is dedicated to the elimination of interaction problems found earlier.",

Collecting and viewing stereo photographs became a craze.\nStereoscopes were produced in different price ranges, thousands of stereo images were printed and bought each year, and one company involved in this boom, The London Stereoscopic Company, proclaimed: \u2018No home without a stereoscope.\u2019\nExplore the origins of the stereoscope and stereo photography\n\u2018Stereoscopy\u2019 derives from the Greek \u2018stereos\u2019 meaning \u2018firm\u2019 or \u2018solid\u2019 and \u2018skope\u014d\u2019 meaning \u2018to look\u2019 or \u2018to see\u2019.

Vamos a examinar el papel cr\u00edtico que tales pr\u00e1cticas han tenido en relaci\u00f3n con las diversas formas de urbanismo y la planificaci\u00f3n social y considerar los mecanismos f\u00edsicos y simb\u00f3licos que separan lo global y lo local, lo urbano y lo rural, lo visible y lo invisible, ciudadanos e inmigrantes, colonos y refugiados.

Los estudiantes tendr\u00e1n que elegir una lecci\u00f3n para completar: El proyecto de m\u00e9todo social o el proyecto flashmob mundial.\n\n\nFicciones, estructuras alternativas e instituciones simuladas: Conferencias, presentaciones por invitados, y prueba\n-Por definici\u00f3n, el arte social es una tarea colectiva. Puede que pretenda a transformar las estructuras sociales y econom\u00edas m\u00e1s amplias. Tal vez, de una manera m\u00e1s modesta, puede que ofrezca algunas alternativas o sencillamente haga frente a retos inmediatos. La producci\u00f3n de un cuerpo colectivo involucrado, raro, o creativo puede ser su objetivo final. En esta lecci\u00f3n vamos a aprender c\u00f3mo artistas socialmente comprometidos han utilizado la apariencia o la forma verdadera de las organizaciones e instituciones como iglesias, corporaciones, bancos, oficinas gubernamentales, y otras entidades sociales como los propios medios de su trabajo. Los elementos pr\u00e1cticos de esta lecci\u00f3n les piden a los estudiantes que inventen sus propias estructuras sociales alternativas o intervenciones ficticias.\n\n\nFicciones, estructuras alternativas e instituciones simuladas: proyectos y evaluaciones\n-El apunte, la lectura, y las presentaciones de los invitados proporcionar\u00e1n la base e inspiraci\u00f3n para los estudiantes en sus propios experimentos con la pol\u00edtica espacial.\n\nLa pedagog\u00eda experimental: conferencias, presentaciones por invitados, y prueba\n-Muchos artistas socialmente comprometidos apostan por la comunicaci\u00f3n de ideas a trav\u00e9s de la educaci\u00f3n o proyectos educativos. De Freire y Boal a Judy Chicago y \u2018Womanhouse\u2019 de Miriam Shapiro y el Programa de Arte Feminista de CalArts, la atenci\u00f3n de esta lecci\u00f3n es un repaso breve de la pedagog\u00eda experimental o radical y su influencia en el arte. Utilizando varias tecnolog\u00edas y formas sociales, algunas de estas obras intentan a transformar la educaci\u00f3n desde dentro. Otras obras se sit\u00faan como plataformas auto-organizadas fuera de las instituciones. Nuestra atenci\u00f3n centrar\u00e1 en c\u00f3mo la producci\u00f3n de las comunidades alternativas de aprendizaje puede cuestionar las jerarqu\u00edas, la profesionalizaci\u00f3n, la homogeneizaci\u00f3n y la econom\u00eda de los sistemas educativos actuales. Componentes pr\u00e1cticos de esta semana van a pedir a los estudiantes que repiensen su relaci\u00f3n con la educaci\u00f3n, eligiendo entre la socializaci\u00f3n a peque\u00f1a escala y la colaboraci\u00f3n enorme.\n\n\nLa pedagog\u00eda experimental: proyectos y evaluaciones por pares\n-El apunte, la lectura, y las presentaciones de los invitados proporcionar\u00e1n la base e inspiraci\u00f3n para los estudiantes en sus propios experimentos con la pol\u00edtica espacial.\n\nConferenciantes invitados adicionales (opcionales) A-Z",

In this first module I will summarize the assignments and expectations of this course, as well as the UI/UX Design Specialization.\n\nWhat IS a user interface anyway?\n-In this first week we will look at some basic broad concepts and contexts for user interfaces, looking at examples both on and off-screen. We will look at basic principles of interaction theory, discuss the relationship between UI and UX, and examine the relationship between coding and designing. We will discuss the roles of functionality and aesthetics in interface design and outline a \"form-first\" philosophy to user interface design. This week will focus on background information and terminology and will give you the context and vocabulary necessary before you start making great interfaces!\n\nFormal Elements of Interface Design\n-This week we are going to examine the various formal elements that make up an interface. We\u2019ll start out with the larger questions of content, context and audience that frame any UI/UX project. In other words: What is it? Who is it for? And, where does it live? And we\u2019ll look at the big picture of overall design direction, what is often referred to as \u201clook and feel\u201d. From there we\u2019ll go into detail of how the basic components of how visual design works in the context of interface design: language, shape, color, imagery, typography, and icons. These areas will be the formal building blocks you will use to create the more complex visual structure of a screen-based user interface.\n\nActive Elements of Interface Design\n-This week we are going to take our static interface elements and begin to think about how a user interacts with them. In other words, how to bring these elements a stage closer to having a life on the screen. We\u2019ll be looking at navigational conventions, such as menus, buttons, and icons in different states. Our focus will move from what the graphic interface looks like, to include how it works and how it responds to the user. By adding interactivity to our static designs, the idea is to think more deeply about the role the designer plays in shaping a user\u2019s interactive experience.\n\nComposing the Elements of Interface Design\n-This week we are going to take our individual interface components and see what happens when we try to put them together into a more complex structure. We\u2019ll be looking at how to get our components to work harmoniously as a family, figuring out how hierarchy works in the interface, and discussing conventions and expectations of contemporary interface design. We\u2019ll also be examining how to navigate to different screens and how to build visual relationships between different kinds of content within a single site. Finally, we\u2019ll be discussing different platforms, how to create variable content for different screen sizes, and looking at how to organize complex bodies of content into user-friendly structures.",

After familiarizing the students with the essential glossary of cinema, the historical development of film as a distinct cultural product will be discussed focusing on its technical/ideological tuning points. The linkages of cinema with other performance/non-performance genres like literature, theatre, music, photography, etc. will be discussed in detail for establishing the interdisciplinariness of film as a cultural product. The key-terms selected for the course will equip the learner to approach cinema as a medium which has got unique specificity. The emphasis of the course is to provide enough conceptual foundations so as to make the students approach the medium theoretically. As a practical component, the students will be given inputs on writing professional film reviews and critical academic articles on cinema. The course will be delivered through four major components: Structural features of film, major movements in cinema, classic filmmakers and their select films, and theoretical essays on cinema.",

        "syllabus": "Design Thinking Capstone\n-Welcome to the Interaction Design Capstone Project!\n\nNeedfinding\n-As Yogi Berra said, you can observe a lot just by watching. Watching how people do things is a great way to learn their goals and values, and come up with design insight. We call this needfinding. This module trains your eyes and ears to come up with user needs, breakdowns, clever hacks, and opportunities for improvement.\n\nIdeation\n-To maximize your chances of having a great idea, it helps to generate a lot of ideas. Brainstorming is a strategy for rapidly generating lots of ideas. It was named by advertising executive Alex Osborn in his 1953 book, Applied Imagination. When brainstorming, go for volume and defer judgment. Often, something that seems like a crazy idea can lead to something that\u2019s a really good idea. Immerse yourself: it can help to use a whiteboard, butcher paper, or stick post-its on a wall. These ideas will become the 'soil' for growing your designs.\n\nPrototype\n-Prototyping is the pivotal activity that structures innovation, collaboration, and creativity in design. Prototyping gets ideas out of your head and into the world. Like a conversation, your ideas will evolve as you articulate them and make them concrete. Prototypes are quick and dirty, not careful museum pieces. The key to prototyping is to jump right in. It\u2019s a tool to see what\u2019s working, what challenges emerge, and to share your ideas with others. Review the user needs you brainstormed. In this assignment, you will flesh out your design ideas by storyboarding and making paper prototypes.\n\nDesign Heuristics\n-Design can succeed (or fail) in many ways. That said, there are common heuristics that will get you on the right path. In this module, you will conduct heuristic evaluations (HEs) of another learner's paper prototype. The heuristic evaluations will be a way to highlight usability issues, and think about how to improve them.\n\nA Plan & a Skeleton\n-A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Figuring out what that first step is--and then what the one after that is--can be especially daunting with creative projects. Making forward progress is a lot easier if you write down concrete, actionable goals. This is the main benefit of a development plan. A development plan also helps you track momentum. Are things progressing at the pace you expected? Faster? Slower? Writing a time estimate into your plan and tracking how long it actually took helps you gauge your pace. The first steps of your plan should be the skeleton that forms the core screens of your design.\n\nReady for Testing\n-Crunch time! Your interactive prototypes have to be ready for user testing by the end of this assignment.\n\nTest your prototype\n-In this assignment, you will test your prototype in person with two people to find usability bugs & potential improvements.\n\nResults!\n-You've got data from online users that compares two alternatives. How can you tell whether there is a real difference? Statistical tests, like the CHI-squared test, tell you whether the behavior you observed was likely to have occurred by chance, or whether there's likely to be a real difference between the designs. A/B experiments like these are becoming increasingly popular in industry because experiments help you test your assumptions.\n\nShow & Tell\n-You've done all this great work, and your hard effort has paid off. You've brainstormed, prototyped, designed, iterated, refined, and evaluated. Now's your chance to share your work with the world. This is a great opportunity to tell your design story, and use it as a portfolio to impress your friends, family, and potential employers.",

        "syllabus": "Module 1: Getting Started\n-This module introduces you to the importance of recognizing good design as the starting place for creating professional, attractive work of your own.\n\nWe will look to the ubiquitous world of graphic design to establish a vocabulary of successful design and to find inspiration for our own projects.\n\nWe will also discuss course prerequisites and review a basic digital design glossary that will help you navigate your chosen application.\n\n\nModule 2: The Blank Canvas\n-This module will look at the blank canvas \u2013 the untouched rectangle that will become our design project. We\u2019ll discuss the importance of working with a grid, understanding negative space, and using appropriate margins. This module will also explore the palette of elements which, when chosen and used wisely, ensure that the finished design project is successful. We\u2019ll cover type, color, images, and graphic elements such as borders, bars, and backgrounds.\n\nModule 3: Tricks of the Trade\n-It's time to start designing! In this module, we'll discuss the process of composition. We'll use the palette items covered in Module 2, and deploy common visual design \u201ctricks\u201d such as contrast, repetition, sublimation, tension, and more. To help see both the effect and the universality of these design approaches, we'll look at design examples from art history, film, and current media. We\u2019ll also cover the strategy of composition. We'll see that providing an obvious target, maintaining a natural visual flow, and prioritizing information are all critical to clear visual communication.\n\nModule 4: Revision and Distance\n-As we've said before, designers don't work in a vacuum. Our work will be judged by others, and, as good designers, we will learn to take that judgement constructively and in stride. In this module we\u2019ll talk about what it means to be confident, yet open to criticism. We\u2019ll explore the importance of revision as an ongoing component of design, as well as the need to enlist feedback and maintain distance in assessing our own work.",

You\u2019ll explore key players in Russian actor training, and through expert panel discussions you\u2019ll consider Meyerhold\u2019s contribution and how his work is still relevant today. You\u2019ll learn Meyehold\u2019s techniques and be introduced to one of his \u00e9tudes \u2013 a short repeatable exercise used by him to develop balance, awareness and expression. You\u2019ll be invited to explore your own responses to this unique training approach and share your work with experts and fellow students.\nThe course is for anyone interested in theatre and training. You may be a student at school or college thinking of going into theatre or you may be at university wanting to widen your areas of interest and experience. Alternatively, you may be a teacher, an actor, a dancer or theatre professional or a life-long learner in the performing arts with an active curiosity for history and theatre training. There will be some movement work, so students need to be of sound physical health, but the physical actions to be explored in the course are manageable for anyone with an average capacity for movement \u2013 lifting the arms, rotating the hips, shifting weight from one leg to the next.

In design practice all kinds of physical scale models and digital models are used side by side.\nIn this architecture course, you will gain experience that will help and inspire you to advance in your personal and professional development. You will attain skills in a practical way. First, we will focus on sketch models for the early stages of a design process, then we will continue with virtual representations for design communication and finally more precise and detailed models will be used for further development of the ideas.\nIn the theoretical part of the course, you will learn about many different sorts of models: how architects use these and how they are essential in the design process.\nThe practical part of the course addresses a number of challenges. In small steps we will guide you through technical and creative difficulties in exciting, playful, and pleasant ways.\nThis is a self-paced course. This means that you can freely plan when and how fast you would like to do the course challenges: within the period of the course duration, you can decide when you are really ready to submit your course portfolio for an online peer review.\n\nThe course team also offers the self-paced MOOC IMAGE | ABILITY and both courses come with a unique magazine called \u2018MIAMIAM\u2019 (Monthly Image Ability & Models in Architecture Magazine). This magazine will present the course feedback and it will report on notable results and insights from both MOOCs and related TU-Delft campus education.\nWith both courses, we invite you to take new steps to explore your own creativity. The forum discussions, the possibilities to share and see each other\u2019s work and the feedback in the magazine make it easier to work towards a course certificate.\nBoth courses are a good preparation for further creative studies and could guide you in a career change towards creative industries.",

We will look at compression, equalization, and delay, and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots of these devices and how they are used in a musical context.\n    \nIn the end, the music production process relies on your creativity. Creativity is a product of the mind and will stay there, unexpressed, until the right tools are used in the right way to share it with the world. If you have an idea in your head, it will take numerous steps, each with an important tool, to reach your audience. You bring the dedication and creativity, and this course will bring you the knowledge to make that happen.",

Make sure to read it right away and refer back to it whenever needed.\n\nActivism and Social Movements: Lectures, Guest Presentations, and Quiz\n-This opening segment is dedicated to the prolific and exciting overlap between socially engaged art and cultural practices generated by recent social movements around the world. Environmentalism, AIDS activism, Queer movements, Zapatismo, immigrant rallies, alter-globalization, the World Social Forum, Occupy, the Hong Kong Umbrella Movement, museum boycotts, and democratic uprisings in the Middle East will be seen in dialogue with cultural producers who participate in these movements or are inspired by them. Rather than assess the political efficacy of such cultural activities, we will examine their place within contemporary art practices. Based on Listening, Organizing, Dancing, or Partying, each student\u2019s contribution will respond to a particular social movement of their choosing.\n\nActivism and Social Movements: Project and Peer Review\n-The prompt, lecture and guest presentations will provide a foundation and inspiration for students\u2019 own experiments.\n\nAesthetics, Art History, and Cultural Institutions - Lectures, Guest Presentations, and Quiz\n-Just as recent social movements have transformed contemporary art and culture, activists have relied on ideas developed in more specialized cultural circles, sometimes without knowing it. Starting with an exploration of the ways in which socially engaged public art has been included and excluded from particular narratives, theories, institutions, and events, we will use this lesson to follow social practices as they question conventional art and art history. As we do so, students will be invited to create projects that directly engage with Cultivating, Farming, Cooking, or Eating\u2014activities that are fundamentally social but traditionally seen to contradict serious artistic production.\n\nAesthetics, Art History, and Cultural Institutions: Project and Peer Review\n-The prompt, lecture and guest presentations will provide a foundation and inspiration for students\u2019 own experiments.\n\nEmbodied Knowledges - Lectures, Guest Presentations, and Quiz\n-This lesson will use the notion of \u2018embodied knowledges\u2019 to link activism and socially engaged art to performance art, gesture, and \u2018writing without words.\u2019 Recognizing that knowledge is inseparable from one\u2019s lived, physical, and social experience, \u2018embodied knowledges\u201d challenge the Western paradigms that separate information from matter, reason from affect, mind from the body, the worker from her labor, the individual from the collective. This lesson\u2019s practical components will ask students to actively think \u2018from\u2019 their particular site of enunciation and \u2018through\u2019 their particular embodied knowledge.\n\nGuest presenters: Mujeres Creando, Regina Jos\u00e9 Galindo, Mariam Ghani, Sharon Hayes, Chemi Rosado-Seijo\n\nEmbodied Knowledge: Project and Peer Reviews\n-The prompt, lecture and guest presentations will provide a foundation and inspiration for students\u2019 own experiments.",

This course is considered Part 2, with a brand new and separate set of lectures. In Part 2, we will cover Beethoven's Piano Sonatas Op. 2, No. 3, Op. 13 (\"Pathetique\"), Op. 53 (\"Waldstein\") and Op. 90 . Please remember that it doesn't matter if you have taken the first part of the previous Exploring Beethoven's Piano Sonatas course. You can jump in here with Part 2 and start learning right away. And if you'd like, you always have the option of going back to take Part 1 of the original course at any time. The items you see here will enable you to get the most out of Part 2 of the course. Please note that there are previous offerings and resources as part of Part 1, and we encourage you to reference those additional items as well.\n\nOp. 2, No. 3\n-The course kicks off with Beethoven's Op. 2 No. 3, an exuberant work full of youth and ambition. The work was a huge statement for 26-year-old Beethoven, and in this lecture Mr. Biss examines how Beethoven starts to innovate the sonata as a musical form, even in his very first opus for the solo piano. In doing so, we'll also lay some groundwork for the next few sonatas to be covered in the course.\n\nOp. 13, \"Pathetique\"\n-The course continues with Beethoven's Op. 13 Sonata, nicknamed the \"Path\u00e9tique.\" Known for its high drama and pathos, the \"Path\u00e9tique\" is a gem from Beethoven's early period and is one of Beethoven's most popular piano sonatas. In this lecture, Mr. Biss uncovers how Beethoven achieves these intense characters within the context of a classical sonata.\n\nOp. 53, \"Waldstein\"\n-The Op. 53 Sonata, nicknamed the \"Waldstein,\" is a monumental achievement and a cornerstone of the piano repertoire. In this lecture, Mr. Biss explains how Beethoven breaks apart conventions in harmony and form to write one of the most adventurous and thrilling compositions of his middle period.\n\nOp. 90\n-The final sonata in this course is Beethoven's Op. 90. As Beethoven had not written a piano sonata for five years prior to the composition of Op. 90, Mr. Biss examines this work as a beginning of a late, mature style and a harbinger of great things to come. We will also uncover how Beethoven, ever the innovator, manages to elevate the sonata form into a new, unfathomable realm.\n\nListening to the Sonatas\n-To supplement your learning during the course, enjoy free access to several of the Jonathan's Beethoven Sonatas recordings.\n\nFeedback Please!\n-We hope you enjoyed the course. Please take a few minutes to share your thoughts with us.",

Although the primary focus is on digital photography, many concepts apply to other photographic disciplines including film and video. Topics include quality of light, exposure control, depth of field, aesthetics, composition and patterns, perspective, color science, the human visual system, spatial and color perception, exposure, metering, digital sensors, optics, analogies to biological systems, color filter arrays, file formats, sensor linearity, color spaces and profiles, optical and computational image artifacts, and software tools and techniques for modification and enhancement. Through lectures, hands-on assignments, and critiques, students expand their understanding of digital photography while exploring their creativity to broaden the possibilities and improve the quality of their photographs. Upon successful completion of the course, students can expect to take photographs with an intuition of the camera's behavior, and its limitations, and an ability to think critically about light and the resulting appearance of a photograph.",

You do not need an art background or museum access to successfully integrate the course materials into your teaching. Your willingness to experiment with new teaching practices is all that is required.\n\nThe strategies presented in this course are adapted from Artful Thinking pedagogy, developed by Project Zero at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. You will explore three thinking dispositions, using eight thinking routines that are easy to understand and implement with STEAM curricular content.\nStarting with the disposition of observing and describing, you will learn how to guide your students in slowing down, using their senses, and communicating impressions of what they see in a work of art...and in other things.\nNext, the routines used in the disposition of reasoning with evidence ask students to make hypotheses about the art and support their arguments with observations.\nFinally, the questioning and investigating disposition challenges students to hone their natural curiosity by expressing their wonderings and formulating open-ended questions.\nThroughout, you will discover the power of art to develop your students\u2019 inclination, motivation, and ability to think deeply.\n\n\nWhen you enroll, all the resources you need for your classroom to strengthen critical thinking by using art will be immediately available. We recommend spending a few hours learning and practicing each section before progressing to the next.\n\n\nThe online course environment features over 20 videos and interactive tools:\n\nParticipating with a global network of educators who, just like you, want to hone their abilities to teach critical thinking skills and explore arts integration will be an added bonus to your course experience.",

        "overview": "First, we'll begin from the year 1868 with Japan's emergence as a new nation. Its new and increasingly Western-style capital city of Tokyo grew upon the foundations of a far smaller seventeenth-century town called Edo surrounding a feudal castle. Before long, changing building methods and materials foretold a different age. By the turn of the twentieth century, a strong contrast between the old-style, low, wooden, Japanese structures and up-to-date modern buildings, first distinguished by red brick and later by industrially produced materials, was clearly visible to any and all.\n\nWe'll discuss the intensive process of Westernization set in motion by Japan's imitation of European and American lifestyles. From that angle, we'll see how architects began to seek out their own version of early twentieth-century Modernism. As a starting point, Japanese practice followed the novel rational and \"functionalist\" innovations of the Franco-Swiss architect Le Corbusier and the stripped-down and up-to-date approach of Walter Gropius, director of the famous German art school known as the Bauhaus. Meanwhile, Japan had embarked upon educating its own architects, who were no longer the older skilled master carpenters trained on site.\n\nA distinct, if frequently eclectic, style evolved with a few younger Japanese seeking experience abroad. Our course seeks to discuss and illustrate the roots of Modernist building in Japan over approximately three quarters of a century in Part 1.",

        "syllabus": "Introduction to the Cycle\n-Welcome! This first week you will be introduced to the course structure and learn the key principles of the Cycle, a management theory which supports thriving arts and cultural organizations and which serves as the framework for the course. The Cycle proposes that: When bold art is marketed aggressively, an organization attracts a family of energized ticket-buyers and patrons. The income produced by this family is reinvested in more art that, when marketed well, builds a larger, even more diverse family. When this cycle repeats year after year, the organization incrementally and sustainably builds capacity, presence, and health. Following the introductory lectures, you will learn more about the Cycle by reading the executive summary, reviewing answers to frequently asked questions, and completing an introductory quiz. As a reminder, if you are taking this course as a student or enthusiast not affiliated with a specific organization, we recommend you select an organization of your choosing to reference as you make your way through the course!\n\nLong-Term Artistic Planning\n-This week, you will learn the benefits of planning your programs further in advance and learn strategies for planning your organizations programs over a five-year time frame. The Cycle proposes that each organization has a rolling, 3-5 year programming plan that is bold, mission-driven, and occasionally surprising. Further, it asks that each organization's programming is the best example of its kind in its environment that forms the basis for aggressive marketing, successful fundraising, and incremental growth in institutional capacity. Following the series of lectures, answers to frequently asked questions, and case studies, you will have the opportunity to apply the principles of long-term artistic planning to your organization using the planning activity provided.\n\nInstitutional Marketing\n-This week introduces institutional marketing, one of two marketing perspectives that is used to aggressively compete for audience attention and loyalty. Institutional marketing is the creative use of organizational assets to create spikes in awareness, energy, and enthusiasm around an organization, beginning with the presentation of transformational art itself and continuing through activities that heighten awareness about the people, process, and other institutional assets behind that art. Following the series of lectures, answers to frequently asked questions, and case studies, you will have the opportunity to apply the principles of institutional marketing to your organization using the planning activity provided.\n\nProgrammatic Marketing\n-Programmatic marketing is the second marketing perspective that the Cycle describes. Programmatic marketing can be defined as the tactics used to identify and target potential audiences for each attraction, create awareness and demand, and drive a sale (of tickets, classes, services, or other experiences). Effective programmatic marketing extends beyond the transaction to contextualize each offering, ensure a high-quality experience, and lay the groundwork for a long-term relationship with the buyer. Following the series of lectures, answers to frequently asked questions, and case studies, you will have the opportunity to apply the principles of programmatic marketing to your organization using the planning activity provided.\n\nFamily and Boards\n-An organization\u2019s family makes up the third aspect of the Cycle. The family is an energized, enthusiastic group of ticket-buyers, board members, donors, trustees, and volunteers that anchors an organization\u2019s financial health through its commitment of time, talent, connections, and financial resources. The heart of the family consists of a joyous, engaged, and excited board of directors. If your organization has a board, you will have the opportunity to apply the principles to your organization's board following the lectures and case studies.\n\nFundraising and Course Summary\n-Fundraising, the final aspect of the Cycle, consists of a strategy for sustainable growth that joins long-term artistic goals, and energized family, and logical options for investment to build organizational resources donor by donor, week by week, month by month, and year by year. Effective fundraising pairs each family member with a logical, financial action in support of the organization\u2019s mission. Following the series of lectures, answers to frequently asked questions, and case studies, you will have the opportunity to apply the principles of fundraising to your organization by developing, or evaluating, your membership program, major donor program, or targeted campaign.",

In order to create an artistic impression, artists select materials that allow image formation, and that lend color, emphasis, shape, and size to the object created.\nA scientist might follow up by asking, why those materials? What characteristics do they have that allow them to embody the artist\u2019s intent? How durable are they? Will they maintain the same qualities, both physical and aesthetic, they had when the work left the studio?\nConservation science further notes that all materials deteriorate over time, and then asks a follow-up question: What physical interventions are possible to maintain, preserve and protect the work as the artist intended? Whatever is done to the art object, the result must be to make the work recognizable as the artist\u2019s work or the result is a failure.\nThat is a key goal of this course: to understand, from a chemical point of view, how conservation protocols and the material aspects of an art work allow a better appreciation of an artwork and its creation, as well as confidence that it is the artist\u2019s work.\nThese are not new problems.

        "overview": "Our relationship to Beethoven is a deep and paradoxical one. For many musicians, he represents a kind of holy grail: His music has an intensity, rigor, and profundity which keep us in its thrall, and it is perhaps unequalled in the interpretive, technical, and even spiritual challenges it poses to performers. At the same time, Beethoven\u2019s music is casually familiar to millions of people who do not attend concerts or consider themselves musically inclined. Two hundred years after his death, he is everywhere in the culture, yet still represents its summit.\n\nThis course takes an inside-out look at the 32 piano sonatas from the point of view of a performer. Each lecture will focus on one sonata and an aspect of Beethoven\u2019s music exemplified by it. (These might include: the relationship between Beethoven the pianist and Beethoven the composer; the critical role improvisation plays in his highly structured music; his mixing of extremely refined music with rougher elements; and the often surprising ways in which the events of his life influenced his compositional process and the character of the music he was writing.) The course will feature some analysis and historical background, but its perspective is that of a player, not a musicologist. Its main aim is to explore and demystify the work of the performer, even while embracing the eternal mystery of Beethoven\u2019s music itself.\n\nThis season's Curtis courses are sponsored by Linda Richardson in loving memory of her husband, Dr. Paul Richardson.\n\nThe Dolfinger-McMahon Foundation supports Curtis's lifelong learning initiatives.",

        "syllabus": "Welcome to Class!\n-We\u2019re happy that you\u2019ve joined us! The items you see here will enable you to get the most out of this course. Please note that many of the items have been updated to reflect the addition of Jonathan\u2019s newest lectures.\n\nHow Things Were\n-To examine the relationship Beethoven had with the piano sonata, we begin by looking at its origins. In this lecture, we will discuss the role of music generally, and of the sonata specifically, in the time of Haydn and Mozart. This lecture will also provide an introduction to the form of the sonata\u2014to the psychological effect sonata structure has on the listener. This background will be necessary to appreciate the innovations Beethoven introduces.\n\nThe First Thirteen\n-Beethoven\u2019s work has traditionally been divided into three or four periods. This is problematic, for various reasons, but the first 13 of the 32 sonatas do, in a sense, form a unit. This lecture will focus on Sonata No. 4, Op. 7, which is the largest and altogether one of the most impressive of the early works.\n\nTopics will include Beethoven\u2019s use of the piano and the use of the sonata as a \u201cvehicle\u201d for the pianist, the ways in which this and other early sonatas conform to the model established by Haydn and Mozart and the ways in which they do not, and the foreshadowing of the fixations of the later years, while holding, at least on the surface, to the conventions of the time.\n\nTopics will include Beethoven\u2019s use of the piano, and the use of the sonata as a \u201cvehicle\u201d for the pianist, the ways in which this and other early sonatas conform to the model established by Haydn and Mozart and the ways in which they do not, and the foreshadowing of the fixations of the later years, while holding, at least on the surface, to the conventions of the time.\n\nNew Paths\n-Beethoven\u2019s conception of the sonata was perpetually in flux, but the year 1801 is a particularly experimental one. The four sonatas Op. 26 through 28 (Nos. 14 through 17, chronologically) feature the most concrete innovations among the sonatas written up to that point, and are the focus of this lecture. There will be discussion of the relationship between the movements in a classical sonata, and the radical shift it begins to undergo at this point. We will also examine the ways in which these sonatas were influential to future generations of composers, which the earlier works, great as they are, were not.\n\nAs a special feature for this lecture, a recording by a current Curtis student of the first movement of Op. 28 will be available on Curtis Performs.\n\nCrisis\n-From 1793 until 1809, Beethoven composed at a steady pace. But for the next several years, he stalled dramatically, as he dealt with the onset of his deafness, severely trying personal circumstances, and the struggle to find what would become his late style, which to a remarkable degree involved the total reinvention of his musical language. This lecture examines the intersection of these three issues, and of his life and music more generally. Works discussed come from this comparatively fallow period and will include the Fantasy, Op. 77, which exemplifies the vital role improvisation played in all of Beethoven\u2019s music, and the Sonatas Op. 78, and 81a, the \u201cLebewohl.\u201d The last of these is one of Beethoven\u2019s only serious experiments with program music, which made it an important reference point for many 19th-century composers. Another topic will be the ways in which the works of this period seem to manipulate time, which was always one of Beethoven\u2019s key fascinations, and becomes ever more critical moving into the late period.\n\n\nTowards Infinity\n-For this lecture, the focus will be on the Sonata Op. 109, the first of the final three, in which Beethoven\u2019s decades-long grappling with the form comes to its astonishing conclusion. We will also look back at the early period\u2014the Sonata Op. 10, No. 1 (the seventh he wrote) in particular\u2014for the purposes of \u201czooming out,\u201d and examining the evolution that took place in the interim: an evolution not just of form, but of style, of musical language, of Beethoven\u2019s conception of the role of music. This lecture will also include a discussion of Beethoven\u2019s legacy\u2014specifically, of the way in which his music came to represent simultaneously the highest possible aspiration and the most insurmountable problem for generations of composers who followed him.\n\nOp. 2, No. 1, and Op. 10, No. 2\n-This lecture delves into two of the early sonatas: the F minor, Op. 2, No. 1 (the first of the 32), and the F Major, Op. 10, No. 2. Unlike \u201cThe First Thirteen\u201d lecture, which was nominally about the Sonata Op. 7 but sought to address the early period in general, this lecture focuses on the specific characteristics that make each of these works unique; one is predominantly a dramatic piece, whereas the other is highly comic. The lecture is also about Beethoven\u2019s complex relationship with the musical past\u2014how he used it as an inspiration even as he tried to leave it behind.\n\nOp. 57: The \"Appassionata\"\n-The topic of this lecture is the Sonata Op. 57, commonly known as the \"Appassionata\"\u2014one of Beethoven\u2019s most iconic works. The sonata\u2019s unusual (for Beethoven) and unrelenting emotional trajectory is a major topic, as is his use of a surprising chord as a sort of \"id\u00e9e fixe,\" helping to unify the work and drive home its extraordinary character. Another critical topic is the way in which the \"Appassionata\" exemplifies Beethoven\u2019s unsurpassed resourcefulness\u2014how he can use the slightest of materials to create a vast canvas.\n\nOp. 101\n-This lecture explores the Sonata Op. 101, commonly thought to be the first sonata that belongs to the late period. Major topics include the first movement\u2019s unusual harmonic instability, and the way in which this becomes a source of the music\u2019s character; the way in which the sonata\u2019s scope expands as it goes along, which helps clarify its status as a late period work, and the sonata\u2019s great influence on later composers, Schumann and Mendelssohn in particular.\n\nLearning Library\n-The Learning Library contains supplementary resources to help you during and after this course: lesson notes, suggested readings, and links to streaming audio files for most of the sonatas explored in the course.\n\nFeedback, Please\n-Please share your experience by taking a few minutes to complete a feedback survey.\n\nAnnouncements and Events\n-Check back here for news and events!",

The only prerequisite is a basic knowledge of how to read musical notation. Otherwise, no prior experience is needed; all concepts will be explained in class, and musical terms will be defined as they arise. This course will focus on Western classical music of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, music that exemplifies tonality, the system of major and minor keys, including pieces composed by Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann, Chopin, Wagner, Brahms, Richard Strauss, and others. This course will tell two competing stories about tonal music and try to reconcile them. On one hand, we will explore what all tonal pieces have in common, the shared musical language that makes them intelligible and allows them to communicate; on the other hand, we will try to discover what makes each piece unique, how composers bend the common language to say something new. Although the course will incorporate historical perspectives, it will not be a chronological survey. Instead, it will combine music theory with aesthetics, balancing principles of structural organization with insights into the aesthetic meaning and effects of these principles. By illustrating his lectures with his own performances at the keyboard, Professor Korsyn will bring the music to life.",

Meet and greet your peers as well!\n\nWhat is Art and How Do We Experience It?\n-In this module, we will discuss philosophers John Dewey and Maxine Greene, and their respective views on the possibilities contained within aesthetic experiences. How can aesthetic experience meaningfully contribute to public life?\n\nDemocracy and the Arts, Part 1\n-How can artistic and aesthetic experiences make a more engaged public? Is there a connection between individual transformative experiences with art and any broader societal impact? What is the role of the artist in a democracy?\n\nDemocracy and the Arts, Part II\n-How have we conceived of the artist's role in American society? What are examples of artists furthering civil society? How do we continually imagine fulfilling the promise of a democracy, embracing Maxine Greene's notion that it is always unfinished?\n\nArts and Urban Renewal\n-How have the arts been a driving force for change in American cities? What are the potentials and pitfalls when positioning artists in this role? This class will pursue these questions through a series of case studies, including a video tour of arts organizations focused on urban renewal in Providence and New Haven, and the development of Lincoln Center in New York City.\n\n20th Century Artists and Social Commitment\n-This class will explore examples of artists from the past hundred years who have been committed to making positive contributions to political or social issues of their time.\n\n21st Century Artists and Social Commitment\n-This class will involve a discussion with performing musicians and a look at examples of artists and musicians from the past hundred years who have been committed to making positive contributions to political or social issues of their time.\n\nCreating Social Action\n-In this final lecture, we will discuss traditions of social action, and how artists work toward building civil society.\n\nFinal Reflection\n-One of the primary goals of this course has been to explore the connections between key concepts from the philosophy of aesthetics, historical examples of musicians who worked toward social action, and contemporary artistic initiatives. This final response is intended to help you consider how these theoretical and historical issues relate to the role of artists and the arts in contemporary life, and how they might apply to your own community and your own involvement with the arts.",

While there isn\u2019t universal agreement on the scope of the field, a set of concepts are clearly representative of gamification. The second lesson explains why the concept of games is deeper than most people realize, and how game design serves as a foundation for gamification.\n\nDeconstructing Games\n-What exactly does it mean to apply game design principles in non-game contexts? In this module, we'll discuss how game designers approach their craft, and how to see any situation through the lens of game design. Then we'll examine the raw materials of games and gamification, known as game elements. We'll earn how to break down a game into its constituent parts and apply them to create gamified systems.\n\nMotivation and Psychology\n-Gamification is a technique for motivation, so it ties very directly into psychology. This unit introduces the major psychological concepts relevant to gamification. The first lesson focuses on behavioral approaches and reward design; the second identifies the risks and alternatives to this approach.\n\nDesign\n-Gamification done well is a form of design. This module describes the design process, and provides a six-step framework to apply to any gamification project. The second lesson identifies important considerations and options for developing creative, human-centered, thoughtful gamification solutions.\n\nApplications\n-This module describes particular challenges and opportunities when applying gamification in two contexts: within an organization, and in social impact or behavior change environments.\n\nGamification in Perspective\n-There are many legitimate limitations, concerns, and dangers from gamification. Some of them can be avoided through thoughtful design, but others must be considered directly in any implementation. The final lesson details gamification-related techniques that go beyond those covered throughout the course, and concludes with a look toward the future.",

Aqui, trataremos de todos os detalhes a respeito do curso e o que voc\u00ea precisar\u00e1 saber para tirar o melhor proveito de sua experi\u00eancia.\n\nIMPROVISA\u00c7\u00c3O COMO UMA LINGUAGEM\n-Como todos aqueles que iniciam esse curso come\u00e7am de um ponto diferente em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 experi\u00eancia individual como improvisadores, \u00e9 importante, primeiramente, tratar de alguns materiais b\u00e1sicos. Come\u00e7aremos nossa jornada explorando a linguagem utilizada pelos improvisadores de jazz. A improvisa\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 an\u00e1loga \u00e0 linguagem de diversas formas. Na m\u00fasica, tornamo-nos fluentes quando o vocabul\u00e1rio (as escalas e os acordes) e a gram\u00e1tica (progress\u00f5es harm\u00f4nicas) s\u00e3o assimilados no conte\u00fado das conversas ou hist\u00f3rias (temas mel\u00f3dicos e estrutura) e j\u00e1 n\u00e3o temos de pensar conscientemente a respeito deles ao tocar.\n\nVOCABUL\u00c1RIO DO IMPROVISADOR\n-Nesta li\u00e7\u00e3o, exploraremos os jarg\u00f5es do improvisador. Identificaremos as escalas de acordes mais comuns e o tipo de harmonia a qual elas se relacionam, incluindo maior, menor e o acorde de s\u00e9tima da dominante\n\nFAZENDO ESCOLHAS DE ESCALA EM TEMPO REAL\n-Os improvisadores devem poder lembrar escalas de acordes rapidamente e conseguir execut\u00e1-las de modo fluente. Isso se torna importante ao escolher qual escala de acorde a ser utilizada em determinada harmonia \u2013 outro detalhe que devemos poder determinar imediatamente. Quando uma nova m\u00fasica \u00e9 colocada \u00e0 sua frente em uma sess\u00e3o ou em um ensaio, n\u00e3o h\u00e1 tempo de levar a m\u00fasica para casa e passar uma ou duas horas trabalhando nas escalas corretas. Improvisadores precisam de um modo r\u00e1pido, quase intuitivo, de tomar essas decis\u00f5es de escalas em tempo real \u00e0 medida que a m\u00fasica vai sendo executada. Nessa semana, exploraremos meu m\u00e9todo para tornar r\u00e1pidas essas decis\u00f5es musicais.\n\nHARMONIA PARA IMPROVISADORES\n-\u00e9 importante para o improvisador implicar claramente as harmonias ao improvisar. N\u00e3o \u00e9 suficiente somente executar as notas corretas em cada acorde. Nesta li\u00e7\u00e3o, examinaremos como o improvisador auxilia a harmonia a seguir em frente. Parte do trabalho do improvisador \u00e9 ajudar o ouvinte a seguir as mudan\u00e7as de uns acordes para outros.\n\nTEMA E VARIA\u00c7\u00c3O\n-Nessa semana, discutiremos como o improvisador desenvolve temas mel\u00f3dicos em um solo. Conforme mencionamos na primeira semana, h\u00e1 compara\u00e7\u00f5es naturais entre a fala e a improvisa\u00e7\u00e3o que ilustram como isso funciona. A t\u00e9cnica mais comum para contar uma hist\u00f3ria musical que cative o ouvinte pela dura\u00e7\u00e3o de seu solo \u00e9 utilizar um conceito tradicional chamado tema e varia\u00e7\u00e3o. Isto \u00e9, voc\u00ea introduz um tema \u2014 uma frase musical \u2014 e o repete, fazendo varia\u00e7\u00f5es sobre esse tema para desenvolver um roteiro interessante. Um bom solo \u00e9 como uma explica\u00e7\u00e3o ou uma boa hist\u00f3ria. A explica\u00e7\u00e3o ou a hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 o conte\u00fado da improvisa\u00e7\u00e3o.",

In this module, you will learn about these scenarios, next to local community scenarios where TV is explored for learning in the classroom and the living room.\n\n\nThis module offers a series of activities for learners to showcase and encourage uptake of the dance pilot tools. The activities will enable learners to build personal dance collections on selected themes and discover how an online annotation tool can support the creation and analysis of dance.\n\n\nWe provide an insight on how to design web-based and mobile services tailor made not only for the visitors but also for museums staff, especially for those who are in charge of designing educational paths, by sharing lessons learned and best practices.\n\n\nWe guide you through the process of managing intellectual property rights from an initial idea through to a start-up business. You will learn how to develop a clear strategy when it comes to intellectual property rights associated with digital cultural content and its commercial re-use. You will be introduced to E-Space tools and case studies which will demonstrate how to clear copyright, source open re-usable content, carry out IP audits and risk assessments, and how to approach licensing and the IPR associated with hackathons, business modelling and incubation.\n\n\nWe stimulate creative ideas on communicating cultural contents with the use of new media, to show how a greater audience can be reached and better engaged by combining the power of social media and storytelling.",

        "syllabus": "The World of the String Quartet\n-Welcome to the World of the String Quartet, where you will hear the extraordinary stories behind great repertoire, discover renowned performers' experiences, and develop keen insight as a listener. This first program samples stunning repertoire from some of the most significant composers: Ravel, Beethoven, Schubert, Tchaikovsky, and Dvo\u0159\u00e1k. What power can four instruments hold?\n\nThe Founders: Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven\n-We begin exploring string quartets during the Classical Era, when balanced structure emphasized variety, contrast, and drama. Discover the starting point of four democratic and personal string voices\u2014and, before long, its development\u2014with Haydn (Op. 33, No. 2, \"The Joke\"), Mozart (K. 465, \"Dissonance\"), and Beethoven (Op. 18, No. 1; Op. 130; and Op. 131). There was a dramatic change in performance from Beethoven's time to our own era. How did that happen?\n\nThe Humanists: Schubert, Mendelssohn, Schumann, and Brahms\n-Personal expression infused Romantic Era compositions, including the string quartets of Schubert (D. 810, \"Death and the Maiden\"), Mendelssohn (Op. 13 and Op. 80), Schumann (Op. 41, No. 3), and Brahms (Op. 51, No. 1). Yet in the generation after Beethoven's towering genius, composers wrote fewer quartets. Why? And where did the followers of Beethoven take the quartet next?\n\nThe Internationalists, Part 1: Smetana, Dvorak, Tchaikovsky, Borodin, and Bartok\n-Beyond German-speaking countries, composers adapted the string quartet to their own cultures\u2014some more so than others. National traits, as well as personal stories, emerge in the heartfelt works of Smetana (\"From My Life\"), Dvo\u0159\u00e1k (Op. 105), Tchaikovsky (Op. 22), Borodin (No. 2), and Bart\u00f3k (No. 5). How does this very individual music convey its national identity?\n\nThe Internationalists, Part 2: Debussy, Ravel, Barber, Shostakovich, and Britten\n-Our international tour continues with France (Debussy and Ravel) and the United States (Barber, Op. 11), a return to the former Soviet Union (Shostakovich, Op. 110), and then to England (Britten, Op. 94), as we follow string quartet stories and techniques from the 1800s into the 1900s. The discoveries of this recent past are preserved by the professional string quartets who worked with these brilliant composers. What do we learn from them\u2014and, from our very own era, the career reflections of the Guarneri Quartet members?\n\nThe Explorers: Schoenberg, Webern, Berg, Ives, Cage, and Reich\n-This program's quartets were written during the 20th century, a time of technological exploration and avant-garde expression. Visionary composers such as Schoenberg (Op. 10), Webern (Op. 5), Berg (Lyric Suite), Ives (No. 1), Cage (String Quartet in Four Parts), and Reich (Different Trains) used four string instruments in ways far different than Haydn. What did these composers dare to do, and how does one play works that present an entirely new and unexplored language?\n\nSpace Odyssey, the Next Frontier\n-We look ahead by first looking back: grappling with the dizzying innovation of Beethoven's late quartets (Op. 130 and the Great Fugue), which challenge performers and listeners still. Then we leap forward to the digital premiere of David Ludwig's breathtaking \"Pale Blue Dot,\" performed by the Dover Quartet, for whom it was written in 2014. To what new frontiers will the seemingly simple yet endlessly varied combination of two violins, a viola, and a cello, take us next?\n\nPlease Tell Us What You Think",

You will explore the process for designing meaningful experiences for your players.

        "syllabus": "Getting Started with Game Design\n-Let's be honest, the process of game design is pretty ambiguous. It is about 90% awesome and 10% terror. As a game designer, you will create things that other people will actually (hopefully) play. Those players will have both positive and negative things to say about your game. It is important to get a sense of what the game design process looks like. In this first module of Principles of Game Design you will create a \"High Concept\" document for your game. You will develop your own game idea leveraging the \"Design | Play | Experience\" (DPE) model and work to understand your role as game designer.\n\nFleshing Out a Game Design\n-There's a significant difference between having an idea and beginning to turn that idea into something tangible. People often confuse the phrases \"flushing out\" and \"fleshing out\". Idea generation is about \"flushing out\" an idea. This module in the Principles of Game Design is focused on \"fleshing out\" your game idea or adding muscle, skin and character to the skeleton created in Module 1. You will explore game worlds of your own creation as well as the kinds of stories you would like to tell through games. By the end of this module you will have created a \"Story Bible\" for your game.\n\nFrom Idea to Implementation\n-Games aren't just about ideas, stories and worlds. They are also interactive systems that players experience. What does it mean to develop gameplay or game systems? This module introduces you to the process of designing gameplay experiences and then how those components can be leveraged in the process of level design. You will explore what it means to \"balance\" a game or move from an idea to something playable by users.\n\nMaking Designs Better\n-Prototyping is one of the most critical skills a game designer can cultivate. The ability to \"find the fun\" in gameplay design is critical to being a successful designer. In this module you will create a prototype of a game idea. This can then be put in front of players allowing you to better understand if the underlying mechanics, systems and aesthetic are something that players may find engaging. This module also encourages you, as an aspiring game designer, to ask questions about the social impact and context of your game. As a designer, it is important to think about the impact that your creativity could possibly have on the world.",

In this course you will practice moving from game concept through design documentation, prototyping and testing. Numerous elements go into the overall process of game design. These range from topics such as idea generation, story, character, and game world development, game mechanics and level design, and user experience design. You will explore the process for designing meaningful experiences for your players. At the end of the course learners will have produced a game&#039;s high concept document, one page blueprint, a physical prototype, pitch and supporting design documentation to move from an idea in your head to a fleshed out design, ready for implementation.",

        "overview": "Early Renaissance Architecture in Italy: from Alberti to Bramante\nWhen Leon Battista Alberti completed his treatise about architecture around 1452, his initial study of texts and monuments of Antiquity was based on mathematics and geometry as a reflection of nature, with a belief that architecture was a part of a man's civil duty.\nThis attitude would condition the architectural principles of the early Renaissance and architects did not apply themselves to textual imitations of individual antique monuments. In Florence, they preferred to accept and articulate the rational \u201csystem\u201d of Brunelleschi, either transforming it, like Alberti, or breaking with it in a return to tradition, like Michelozzo. In north and south Italy, the battle between innovation and resistance was increasing in strength and substance because it not only encompassed immediate questions of decorative language  (antique forms and architectural orders) but also the problems of conceiving and constructing an architecture that could replace the gothic structural membering with the continuous masonry of the Antiquity. At first, the new decoration was frequently adapted to the existing architectural system, and only later did it find a partner in the different spatial and structural conceptions that descended from Florentine exempla. The tendency to see norms and models in antique architecture, which must be rigidly replicated, first affirmed itself at the beginning of the XVI century in Rome.",

In paintings from this period, we find traces of the emergence of the modern mind set, and perspective on issues such as the respective roles of women and men in the world.\nThis course focuses on images of paintings by the artists listed in the course syllabus.

You will be able to illustrate concepts and themes and you will know how to unravel complexity by using diagrams and schemes.\n\nThis is a self-paced course. This means that you can freely plan when and how fast you would like to do the course challenges: within the period of the course duration, you can decide when you are really ready to submit your course portfolio for an online peer review.\n\nThe course team also offers the self-paced MOOC \u2018Models in Architecture\u2019 and both courses come with a unique magazine called \u2018MIAMIAM\u2019 (Monthly Image Ability & Models in Architecture Magazine). This magazine will present the course feedback and it will report on notable results and insights from both MOOCs and related TU-Delft campus education.\nWith both courses, we invite you to take new steps to explore your own creativity. The forum discussions, the possibilities to share and see each other\u2019s work and the feedback in the magazine make it easier to work towards a course certificate.\nBoth courses are a good preparation for further creative studies and could guide you in a career change towards creative industries.",

In this week, I\u2019ll introduce both principles and software tools for effective pixel prototyping. These rapid prototypes for communication within a design team and for getting buy-in from stakeholders. If you walk into any design studio, you\u2019ll likely see these fast prototypes adorning the walls. Now you can add your own to the mix.\n\nFlexible Layout\n-There\u2019s more than seven billion people on the planet, and just about that many computing devices. Given that scale and diversity, interface design can\u2019t be one-size-fits-all. In this module, we\u2019ll dive into the rationale and strategies for making designing interfaces more flexibly. We\u2019ll talk about internationalization--i18n for you wonks and 1337 h4x0rs--and the interplay between script direction and interface layout. And we\u2019ll discuss responsive design: having a \u2018family\u2019 interface strategy that grows, shrinks, and changes to accommodate a range of device form factors.\n\nNew devices, big data\n-In this lecture, you will learn how to design smart things.

Da una parte l\u2019architetto milanese Franco Albini, con la sua misurata \u201carte del porgere\u201d gli oggetti nello spazio, dall'altra Luigi Moretti, con la sua profonda riflessione dedicata ai rapporti tra struttura, forma e spazio. Vedremo esiti sorprendenti, sia nel campo delle figure costruite, sia in quello della teoria dell\u2019architettura.\n\nViaggi nell'architettura contemporanea\n-Questa ultima sezione \u00e8 un viaggio tra gli esempi di architettura contemporanea.Si tratta prevalentemente di spazi per la vita sociale che narrano le memorie del passato e disegnano nuovi luoghi nelle citt\u00e0 e nelle campagne. La selezione \u00e8 parziale e soggettiva, ma rappresenta un invito aperto a chiunque voglia comprendere le ragioni della bellezza. In ogni caso, il commento critico lascia sempre un posto all'esercizio del dubbio, dove protagonista \u00e8 il Tempo, a cui ogni architetto consegna le proprie geniali fatiche.",

The fundamentals of acoustics are an essential component while designing specific spaces small and big like recording studios, class rooms, lecture halls, auditoriums. The Architectural Acoustics course is broadly classified into three sub sections and comprises of 8 modules: After introduction to the course the lectures will be on sound physics. Lectures will include various characteristics of sound, its origin, propagation and auditory sensation and the measurement techniques. Difference in behaviour of sound in closed and open spaces and the mathematical calculations will also be covered. The primary focus of the second part is on acoustical design of spaces which includes room acoustics, understanding the phenomena of reverberation and sound absorption and finally design spaces where the primary purpose is related to achieving good sound quality. It includes small spaces like class room to lecture halls or large spaces like cinema halls and auditorium. The third subsection of the course will cover the aspects of environmental noise control - both air borne and structure borne.\n\nINTENDED AUDIENCE:Anyone can learn from this course.\nPREREQUISITES: Basic knowledge of Mathematics, Physics and Architecture.\nINDUSTRY SUPPORT:Architectural Design Firms, Acoustical consultancy companies.

        "overview": "Shakespeare wrote for a popular audience and was immensely successful. Shakespeare is also rightly regarded as one of the greatest playwrights the world has known. This course will try to understand both Shakespeare\u2019s popularity and his greatness by starting from a simple premise: that the fullest appreciation of Shakespeare can be achieved only when literary study is combined with analysis of the plays as theatre. Hence, as we delve into the dimensions that make Shakespeare\u2019s plays so extraordinary--from the astonishing power of their language to their uncanny capacity to illuminate so much of human life--we will also explore them in performance from Shakespeare\u2019s own theatre to the modern screen. At the same time, actors will occasionally join our effort and demonstrate ways of bringing the text alive as living theatre. Plays to be studied will include Romeo and Juliet, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Much Ado About Nothing, Othello, King Lear, and The Winter's Tale.\nImage courtesy Castle Rock Entertainment/The Kobal Collection\nBefore your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs.

Estar atentos a ellos y potenciar los que desarrollan la creatividad depende de nosotros. En estas 8 lecciones nos introduciremos al \u201clado oscuro\u201d que intenta bloquear nuestra creatividad y la de quienes nos rodean, pero tambi\u00e9n a formas de ver la realidad y de comportarnos que facilitan que seamos m\u00e1s creativos.\n\nEstrategias para ser m\u00e1s creativos\n-En este m\u00f3dulo estaremos revisando algunas estrategias muy efectivas para generar pensamiento divergente y para construir soluciones, ya sean ideas, productos o servicios. Algunas tienen que ver con un proceso individual, y tambi\u00e9n estaremos explorando el proceso de creaci\u00f3n a partir de la lluvia de ideas (incluso presenciaremos el surgimiento de un cuaderno de notas muy especial). Para quienes sientan alg\u00fan peque\u00f1o tropiezo, tambi\u00e9n tendremos un video que debe abrirse en caso de emergencia creativa.\n\n\nHeur\u00edsticas y modelos\n-Este m\u00f3dulo que permite entender la funci\u00f3n de las heur\u00edsticas o caminos cortos para solucionar problemas, as\u00ed como un modelo muy \u00fatil para generar y evaluar soluciones creativas: el de Osborn y Parnes. Termina con una visita al campo de design thinking, un movimiento relevante en el \u00e1rea de la creatividad.\n\nAlgunos Elementos Sorprendentes\n-Este m\u00f3dulo nos permite explorar c\u00f3mo frasear problemas de forma que sea m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil solucionarlos, la relaci\u00f3n entre humor, estado de \u00e1nimo y creatividad, as\u00ed como algo que parece muy contraintuitivo: el valor positivo que tienen las restricciones cuando buscamos soluciones creativas.",

We will start with clarifying the basic principles of human-human communication and human-machine interaction. We will then describe the processes taking place in humans when perceiving auditory, visual and tactile signals, as well as how these perceptions are integrated in order to form a multimodal perception. The signals can be generated and received by machines which are able to interact with humans in limited domains. The set-up of such machines will be discussed, and limitations as well as potential solutions to overcome these limitations will be explained.",

After mapping out our strategy and scope in the previous course, Web Design: Strategy and Information Architecture, this is the first time in the process that we will address the screen. Now things are going to get much more concrete as we\u2019re starting to actually lay out elements for the user interface. This week you will learn why working on wireframes first\u2014before designing high-fidelity mockups\u2014is a helpful intermediate step. I\u2019ll also talk about responsive design, navigation systems, wayfinding, common design patterns, and strategies for homepage design. And, we\u2019ll discuss which tools are most appropriate for creating wireframes. Because creating those will be your assignment at the end of the week.\n\nFinally, Make it Beautiful: The Mockup Phase\n-We finally reached the point that many of you\u2014especially if you consider yourself a visual designer\u2014have probably been waiting for. We\u2019ll now talk about designing the look and feel for your website. Meaning, we\u2019re ready to design visual mockups. Finally, you\u2019ll get to decide on colors, typefaces, and images. Maybe you\u2019ll create a few illustrations. And your site will need a logo, too. This week, we\u2019ll focus on designing the visual mockups of just the homepage. To find some inspiration, I\u2019ll also have you create a mood board.\n\nAn Excursion to Codelandia\n-This week, you\u2019ll continue the visual design of your websites, refining the look and feel based on peer feedback. Having worked on the homepage mockup last week, it\u2019s time to design the remaining screens. As an important aside, I will take you on a short expedition to the land of code. Although this specialization isn\u2019t about learning how to code, I want to at least introduce you to the technologies that make the web work. And we\u2019ll look at a few coding examples. After all, the web is built upon certain languages\u2014HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. in order to be an effective UX designer, it is helpful to have a rudimentary understanding of these technologies.\n\nPutting it all Together: Final Presentation\n-Welcome to the final week of this course and the final week of the entire UI/UX Design Specialization. I hope that you learned a lot of new concepts, techniques, and skills that will allow you to design some amazing interactive experiences in the real world. This week, you will have time to revise any of your project components. And then I\u2019d like you to assemble them into a presentation that will represent the culmination of all of the UX phases we covered. This should be a great project to include in your portfolio. I\u2019ll also show you how to take your static mockups and assemble them into clickable prototypes.",

Sch\u00f6nberg's piano works are windows into the stylistic trajectory of the composer's entire output, and we will follow his development from late Romanticism to serialism, one of the key techniques in Western classical music in the 20th century.\nWe will discuss the history and musical details of each work and give suggestions for pianists who are practicing and performing the compositions. We will also encounter related compositions by other composers and get a tour of Sch\u00f6nberg's house in Austria. You will be able to test your knowledge using review questions and compare your reflections on course content with other students.\nYou will explore:\nSch\u00f6nberg's solo piano music and its historical context.\nVocabulary and strategies for analyzing the music and your responses to the music.\nHow to practice and perform the compositions.\nAdditional, related repertoire.",

In this first module I will summarize the assignments and expectations of this course.\n\nIdeation, Articulation, Development\n-Your assignment at the end of this week is the first stage in a multi-step process towards developing a clickable prototype: coming up with a clearly articulated idea for an app with a specific goal in mind. So this week we will focus on how to articulate and structure your ideas and goals, how to use naming and language as a part of your app\u2019s identity. We will also look at audience research and user centered design.\n\nPlanning, Testing, Researching, Mapping\n-This week we\u2019re going to continue to develop, plan, and test your app idea. We\u2019ll start by sketching out more extensive content and mapping it into a structure. To test what aspects of your app are working, we\u2019ll look at how to create a non-visual paper prototype and work our way towards a sitemap. While you\u2019re developing the logic of your app, you\u2019ll also begin to develop the look and feel of it: the visual development process.\n\nWhat Goes Where?\n-At this stage in our process we are going to take our site map, look and feel research, and user testing to the next level in order to get a more accurate static prototype. By building a wireframe of our interface, we\u2019ll figure out what goes where, and on which pages, utilizing our user testing information to figure out the hierarchy and structure of our app. This week is about the logic and functionality of our interface, and how it\u2019s actually going to work within the app.\n\nMaking it by Faking it\n-In this final week of the course, you will be taking your wireframes or app screens and make a simple functioning digital prototype to simulate the experience of interactivity. We\u2019ll be using simple prototyping software to put your static screens into a realistic context, and simulating interaction in order to understand how your app feels, in order to troubleshoot and fix problems. This is the part of the course where all your talents come together! For me this is the most exciting part of UI/UX development, when it all starts to become real and you have a believable prototype in your hands.",

But over the past 10-15 years, DAWs and the act of recording music have evolved from being a luxury of the few to being available to the masses. Ableton Live is one such application. Used by an extremely broad range of music creators, Ableton Live not only facilitates the work of engineers, producers, and writers in professional, home, and mobile studio settings, but it is also a powerful platform for musicians on stage, in the DJ booth, and elsewhere.\n\nIn this course, you will explore some of Live\u2019s most powerful and useful functionality: MIDI programming, audio recording, warping and processing, looping editing, mixing, performing, file management, and troubleshooting. Meant to be a springboard for those who are new to Ableton Live and/or DAWs in general, this three-week course will provide you with a strong knowledge base for using Live to take your musical ideas from conception to final recording. The course breaks down the many barriers of entry into music technology and encourages all those who wish, to create fearlessly.\n\nNote: If you do not own Ableton Live 9, you can download the free, fully featured Ableton Live Trial. The trial version will allow you to save and export your work for 30 days. If you use the trial version, do not download it until the course is scheduled to begin.",

Here we will cover all the details about the course and what you'll need to know to get the most out of your experience.\n\nGetting Our Hands Dirty\n-In this lesson I'm going to demonstrate how to get set up in Live, whether you have an audio interface or just your computer. We'll also look at saving and submitting your sessions, devices, MIDI drums, and MIDI synths.\n\nPolishing the Sound\n-We'll be moving from MIDI to audio and implementing effects, which will give your sessions even more personality and depth. We'll also be diving into Audio Warping, which is one of Ableton's most powerful functionalities and is the cornerstone of remixing.\n\nThe Endless Possibilities\n-This week we're going to dive into some more advanced production techniques, the very basics of mixing, and I'll get into some valuable information regarding file management and troubleshooting. Hopefully with this new information you'll be able to tie together a lot of what we've learned in the past two weeks and bring your music to the next level.",

We will trace development of the city since its foundation in 1609 until today by discussing the work of some of its most influential architects. We will develop a critical view on architecture and learn how to \u201cread\u201d buildings both from their exteriors and interiors. We will examine the evolution of New York and at the same time try to understand the recent challenges and opportunities for architecture and the city.\nThis course will offer on-site architectural tours of New York City in relation to the 6 weeks of the course. We will visit selected areas of Manhattan, an urban laboratory for history, economics, social context, construction, and design. Course participants will learn the progression of development from a village to a contemporary metropolis and hence to a world city. We will draw, read, take pictures and engage in exiting online and in-person discussions about the architecture of New York.\nLEARNING OUTCOMES\nCourse participants will develop an understanding of the development of the city, including an overview of economic and market realities, the needs of infrastructure, the imposition of regulatory code requirements, as well as the \u201cfilter-up\u201d of aesthetics in the overall construct of the City.  Physical shape began with the very initial colonial claims on the land, but has also been formed by various cultural interventions over the past 400 years.",

Their artist-researchers are joined by experts from international institutions across the globe, who share their experience and understanding. The course is intended to be accessible to musicians with an expert artistic practice and some engagement with its theory, history, and context \u2013 as well as an inquiring mind. Masters or advanced Bachelors students will find this relevant, as well as researchers beginning their PhD, teachers at conservatories or universities, and independent artists who wish to engage with this exciting field.",

We can ask, what are the buildings or spaces saying? How do they say it? How does it all stitch together?\nIn this architecture course you will learn how to \u201cread\u201d Rome, an ancient city, reborn in the fifteenth century and reshaped substantially in the following three centuries. You will discover how Renaissance and Baroque Rome\u2019s urban form, art, and architecture projected the city\u2019s image of itself to its citizens (urbi) and the world (orbi).\nPopes, architects, scholars and sculptors invested in Rome a variety of narratives that strove to explain the city\u2019s history, convince its citizens and visitors of its harmony, and exhort society at large to share in and shape its destiny. The city that resulted became a destination for pilgrims and Grand Tourists, and still is today.\nThe Meaning of Rome: The Renaissance and Baroque City is organized around three themes\u2014the city and memory, the city as reliquary, and the city as theater. In uncovering some of the meaning of Rome, you will be equipped with the skills necessary to consider how our own cities and communities are, or could be, meaningful. You will come away from this course not only better informed about the cities of the past, but also better equipped to think about the cities of the present and the future.",

Pour sortir des m\u00e9thodes classiques et des conceptions \u00abtopdown\u00bb, de nouvelles approches se d\u00e9veloppent. Regroup\u00e9es sous le vocable\u00abinnovation publique\u00bb, ces approches placent la cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 et la prise en compte de l\u2019usager au c\u0153ur de leurs logiques d\u2019action. Elles invitent \u00e0 repenser le rapport des administrations au terrain et la conception des politiques publiques.\nD\u00e9velopp\u00e9s dans de nombreux pays (Danemark, Etats-Unis, Grande-Bretagne, Canada, Chili\u2026), les laboratoires d\u2019innovation publique apportent une r\u00e9ponse concr\u00e8te \u00e0 ces enjeux de transformation. Au sein ou en dehors d\u2019une institution, un \u00ab lab \u00bb propose \u00e0 la fois un espace et un cadre m\u00e9thodologique pour exp\u00e9rimenter de nouvelles fa\u00e7ons de faire et diffuser une culture de l\u2019innovation aupr\u00e8s des agents.\nAujourd\u2019hui en France, les administrations (collectivit\u00e9s, Etat, op\u00e9rateurs\u2026) s\u2019engagent dans la mise en place de labs.

        "syllabus": "What is Creativity?\n-In this module, we will be featuring the skill \u201cLook at it Another Way\u201d. This skill is about becoming aware of what ideas, challenges, and solutions feel like from multiple perspectives, views, or mindsets. These ideas may manifest as spoken words or internal thoughts. For example, take a moment to picture a tree. What does it look like? Does it have leaves? What season are you in? Did you picture the tree from straight on? If so, try picturing the tree from a birds-eye view, or from an ant's perspective. If your tree was in full bloom, picture the same tree in winter. It probably looks much different! That's what this module is all about looking at things from different perspectives in order to gain new insights! As you go through this module's lessons, we would like you to consider the following things: * What might be all of the different ways to look at these lessons and assignments? * How does changing your perspective spark your imagination? * When deliberately employing this skill, do you feel more creative? We encourage you to keep this description handy, as we will be asking you to apply this skill throughout the module. Ready? Let's get started! * Skill taken from Torrance, E.P., & Safter, H.T. (1999). Making the creative leap beyond... Hadley, MA: Creative Education Foundation Press.**\n\nThe Creative Person\n-In this module, we will be featuring the skill, \u201cVisualize it Richly and Colorfully\u201d. This skill is about using the five senses to paint a vivid picture of what you're trying to explain or understand.This module will require you to use your imagination during the lessons and the subsequent assignments. We will ask you to picture the many aspects of certain objects -- such as apples -- or to remember something as vividly as possible. Let's give it a shot: picture a flower. It doesn't matter what kind of flower it is -- it doesn't even have to be one that is known to humankind! What does the flower look like? What colors make up the petals? How many petals are there? Does the stem have thorns? Do the thorns hurt? Are the petals soft? Are they damp from a recent dew? How does the flower smell? What do you hear? Is there a bee buzzing around the flower? Are you brave enough to taste the flower? I know that sounds like a lot of questions, but you should incorporate all five senses into the lessons within this module. As you go through this module's lessons, we would like you to consider the following questions: * How does visualization make your memories come alive?* How does visualization spark your imagination?* When deliberately employing this skill, do you feel more creative? We encourage you to keep this description handy, as we will be asking you to apply this skill throughout the module.Ready? Let's get started!* Skill taken from Torrance, E.P., & Safter, H.T. (1999). Making the creative leap beyond... Hadley, MA: Creative Education Foundation Press.\n\nThe Creative Press\n-In this module, we will be featuring the skill Enjoy and Use Fantasy. This skill is about imagination, and it is an integral part of creativity and learning. The ability to enjoy and use fantasy is a skill that can be applied to many facets in life. Though it is often misconstrued as inconvenient or inappropriate (especially as we get older), fantasy has been shown to motivate learning while providing a non-threatening environment. The employment of the skill Enjoy and Use Fantasy improves thinking, logic, and communication skills!\n\nFor example, imagine you\u2019ve been given access to the world\u2019s first time machine. As of right now, it only has one setting: to take you on a journey 1000 years forward in time. Just think! You will be the first person from the present to see what the future looks like: what people will be wearing, what businesses will be in place, what governments will be standing, and the effects of the human race on the entire planet. With 100% assurance that the time machine is 100% safe, you hop in and press the One Button: GO!\n\nHow do you feel? Is your mind racing with ideas of what you might see? Are you excited to be a part of an unknown future? Are you nervous about running into a future relative? Good \u2013 that\u2019s the point!\n\nAs you go through this module\u2019s lessons, we would like you to consider the following things:\nAre you fully experiencing the joy and child-like nature of fantasy?\nHow does the deliberate use of fantasy spark your imagination?\nWhen deliberately employing this skill, do you feel more creative?\nReady? Let\u2019s get started!\n\nThe Creative Process\n-In this module, we will be featuring the skill Break Through and Extend the Boundaries. This skill is about thinking outside of the prescribed requirements. You may know it better by the phrase \u201cthink outside the box\u201d \u2013 but we want you to think of it as more than that. Expanding the boundaries is a skill that everyone possesses (though it can be developed and honed through practice), and is integral to creativity and problem solving. For example, have you ever had a child, student, or colleague who was perfectly content to give run-of-the-mill answers to intriguing questions? Sure, the answers were applicable and solved the problem at hand, but they lacked the innovation and excitement that you were after. Then one day, in frustration, you told that person to \u201cthink outside the box\u201d \u2013 and he astounded you with an answer that was completely out of left field! As you go through this module\u2019s lessons, we would like you to consider the following things: \u2022 Are you thinking beyond the prescribed requirements? \u2022 How does extending the boundaries spark your imagination? \u2022 When deliberately employing this skill, do you feel more creative? We encourage you to keep this description handy, as we will be asking you to apply this skill throughout the module. Ready? Let\u2019s get started! *Skill taken from Torrance, E.P., & Safter, H.T. (1999). Making the creative leap beyond\u2026 Hadley, MA: Creative Education Foundation Press.\n\nThe Creative Product\n- In this module, we will be featuring the skill \u201cCombine and Synthesize\u201d. This skill is about making new connections with what we already know, and combining relatively unrelated ideas and concepts. For example, perhaps you're having trouble keeping up with your household chores. You understand their importance, but you can never seem to find the time to get them done. You take a few minutes to generate ideas, but they're the same old ones you've tried before. So, in order to come up with more novel ideas, you decide to combine your current challenge with your strengths. Perhaps you're an engineer, or you love to paint, or you're a motivational speaker. You combine the skills and tools that you already know with the problem at hand, and you come up with brand new ideas that play to your strengths! As you go through this module's lessons, we would like you to consider the following things: * What unrelated concepts might you combine to produce more novel solutions? * How does making connections spark your imagination? * When deliberately employing this skill, do you feel more creative? We encourage you to keep this description handy, as we will be asking you to apply this skill throughout the module.Ready? Let's get started! *Skill taken from Torrance, E.P., & Safter, H.T. (1999). Making the creative leap beyond... Hadley, MA: Creative Education Foundation Press.\n\nPutting Ideas into Context\n-In this module, we will be featuring the skill \"Put Ideas into Context\". This skill is about putting smaller parts or experiences into a larger framework, or putting things together in meaningful ways. This is the perfect skill with which to bring our MOOC to a close. During this module, and as you continue on with your Everyday Creativity experiences, we would like you to think about everything that you have learned throughout this course. Try to apply the lessons to your everyday life. Remember, the learning doesn't end with this course! Creativity is a skill that can be constantly developed -- all you have to do is put what you've learned into context! As you go through this module's lessons, we would like you to consider the following things: * How might you apply what you have learned in this course to your everyday life?* When deliberately employing this skill, do you feel more creative? We encourage you to keep this description handy, as we will be asking you to apply this skill throughout the module.Ready? Let's get started!",

Current research in experimental psychology suggests that creativity can be developed and refined, albeit with effort and practice. The goal of this course is to provide a variety of experiences and activities with the specific focus of fostering each student\u2019s own creative abilities.\n \nAs valued work becomes less routine, the oft referred to \u201cconceptual age\u201d provides the opportunity for managers who can see, think and act differently on new challenges.\n \nCreativity is often misunderstood as being only for the few, or only when considering new products. This course will show how creative approaches can be learned and widely applied, beyond new products and services, to a wide range of managerial challenges.\nThis course will make you more effective as an innovator in your organization by giving you practical tools for fostering effective problem solving and innovation efforts in an organization.\n\nYou will earn a professional certificate from the University of British Columbia and edX upon successful completion of this course.

        "description": "Successful contemporary business practices rest upon the ability to see problems clearly and to develop solutions unseen and unimagined by others. To do so requires creativity. Current research in experimental psychology suggests that creativity can be developed and refined, albeit with effort and practice. The goal of this course is to provide a variety of experiences and activities with the specific focus of fostering each student\u2019s own creative abilities.\n\u00a0\nAs valued work becomes less routine, the oft referred to \u201cconceptual age\u201d provides the opportunity for managers who can see, think and act differently on new challenges.\n\u00a0\nCreativity is often misunderstood as being only for the few, or only when considering new products. This course will show how creative approaches can be learned and widely applied, beyond new products and services, to a wide range of managerial challenges.\nThis course will make you more effective as an innovator in your organization by giving you practical tools for fostering effective problem solving and innovation efforts in an organization.\n\nYou will earn a professional certificate from the University of British Columbia and edX upon successful completion of this course. Certificates can be uploaded directly to your LinkedIn profile.",

In this course, we will explore the ancient cities of Chang'an of Han, Luoyang of Northern Wei, Chang'an and Luoyang of Sui and Tang, Kaifeng of Song and Dadu of Yuan, and delve into the history of the awe-inspiring ancient buildings that still grace the landscape of these bustling cities. The course will cover construction and aesthetics of these imperial palaces, religious structures, pagodas, tombs and gardens. We will study the basis of Chinese architecture, the wood framed building, as well as the brick and stone construction of many Buddhist pagodas and tombs. The course will culminate in an examination of the Summer Palace in Beijing, the ancient royal garden at the Chengde Mountain Resort, and the private gardens of the Ming and Qing dynasties.

In this module, you\u2019ll learn how good input is more than just preference, trace input from the fingertip to the screen, and think about the diversity of possible input devices and their relative merits.\n\nSearch & Navigation\n-We live in an information-rich world. Consequently, the hardest part of interaction is often finding what we want or finding something that we didn\u2019t know what to ask for. From e-commerce to digital libraries, good search design is central to human-computer interaction in the 21st century.\n\nGestural Interfaces\n-The graphical user interface with windows, icons, menus, and pointers (WIMP) was a massive advance beyond the command line. It also took 20 years to go from research labs into people\u2019s homes. We\u2019re in the midst of a new sea change now. Gestural interfaces can be even more direct and more natural. They can also be even more frustrating. In this module, you\u2019ll learn how to tell the difference and design gestural interfaces that work.",

        "syllabus": "Contemporary Scandinavian Film and TV Culture and Dreyer's Classical Cinema\n-This module consists of two lessons. The first lesson offers an introduction to main trends in the contemporary Scandinavian film and television culture, focusing \u2013 among other things \u2013 on how the national film and television cultures relate to ideas of the welfare state. The module also addresses the international impact of film and television from Scandinavia. The second lesson deals with the early years of cinema in Scandinavia and the work of the Danish director Carl Th. Dreyer, from a silent film classic such as 'The Passion of Joan of Arc' to the sound film era.ist\n\nIngmar Bergman and Lars von Trier\n-'The Seventh Seal', 'Persona' and 'Cries and Whispers' are just some of the famous films by the acclaimed Swedish director Ingmar Bergman. The third lesson focuses on issues of influences, themes and style in his films as well as on Bergman's importance for the modern art cinema. The fourth lesson deals with the internationally renowned ideas and films by the Danish director Lars von Trier: 'The Europa-trilogy'; The TV series 'Riget'/'The Kingdom'; 'Breaking the Waves'; 'Dancer in the Dark' and 'Dogville'; The Dogma 95 Manifesto; 'Antichrist', 'Melancholia' and 'Nymphomaniac' ...\n\nNew Wave, Art Cinema and Social Drama\n-Many people have heard of the French new wave cinema, 'la nouvelle vague'. The fifth lesson deals with the main tendencies of the Scandinavian new wave cinema and some of its 'auteurs'. The sixth lesson focuses on different tendencies in the Scandinavian art film and social drama after 1990, ranging from award-winning heritage films to harsh stories from the contemporary Scandinavian welfare societies.\n\nDocumentary and Early TV Drama\n-Scandinavian cinema has a long history of strong documentary film making. The seventh lesson moves from the early documentary filmmakers to the contemporary \u2013 global and digital \u2013 scene for Scandinavian documentaries. Television drama is important for the Scandinavian public service broadcasters, but the notions of good television drama have changed remarkably from the early days of television up until today. In the eighth lesson we focus on the main tendencies in these developments from 1960 to 2000.\n\nModern TV Drama and the Digital Revolution\n-With 'Nordic Noir' such as 'Wallander' and 'Forbrydelsen/The Killing' becoming a 'brand' in the 2010s, some 'Scandi crime' series were suddenly of interest to international as well as national audiences. The ninth lesson focuses on Scandinavian television drama after the millennium and addresses some of the changes in the production framework that helped the series move from the national to the international realm. The tenth and final lesson discusses how to understand the contemporary Scandinavian film and television culture in a global and digital era. What might the transnational future bring?",

        "overview": "Il corso intende fornire allo studente i basilari principi geometrici per la progettazione e la gestione del progetto di quelle scene teatrali, che fondano la propria espressivit\u00e0 sugli effetti prospettici delle architetture e degli spazi illusori allestiti sul palcoscenico. La scenografia teatrale \u00e8 una disciplina caratterizzata da un insieme complesso di fasi, che mirano ciascuna a ricreare un voluto effetto illusorio, ideato in prima istanza dallo scenografo con la creazione del bozzetto della scena. Il bozzetto, realizzato in prospettiva, \u00e8 una immagine pittorica che contiene tutte le indicazioni necessarie all'allestimento della scena, di cui deve essere garantita l'esatta trasposizione nello spazio del palcoscenico. Lo strumento di progettazione, controllo e di realizzazione della voluta illusione progettata nel bozzetto una particolare scena \u00e8 da secoli la prospettiva. Il corso fornisce alcuni indispensabili principi geometrici per la progettazione della prospettiva solida accelerata, metodo illusorio di costruzione di uno spazio fisico che simula agli occhi degli spettatori profondit\u00e0 maggiori di quelle realmente esistenti nello spazio del palco teatrale.\nAttraverso un sintetico percorso tra le tappe storiche fondamentali toccate dalla scenografia dal XVI secolo ad oggi e grazie all'acquisizione di alcuni cenni di scenotecnica, il corso si propone di guidare lo studente nella gestione dei processi geometrici che intervengono nella trasposizione scenica del bozzetto, dall\u2019immagine dipinta, e dunque bidimensionale, alla tridimensionalit\u00e0 dello spazio del palcoscenico teatrale. Si presentano infine i lavori di tre tesi di laurea, allo scopo di mostrare allo studente come un uso consapevole della dei processi prospettici applicati alle illusioni della scena teatrale ha reso possibile tre proposte di allestimento di alcune tra le principali e pi\u00f9 famose opere liriche: l\u2019Aida, la Tosca e la Madama Butterfly.\n***\nThe scope of this course is to provide the students with the basic geometrical\nprincipals on the planning and management of those theatrical scenes characterized by the stage\u2019s architecture and illusion spaces\u2019 perspective effects.\nTheatrical scenography is made of several complex phases aiming at recreating\nan intended illusory effect firstly sketched by the scenographer. The sketch is made in perspective and it consists in a painting containing all the instructions needed for its exact implementation on the stage. In fact, the planning, control and reproduction of a specific desidered illusion on a scene has been granted for centuries now, by perspective. This MOOC will present some of the essential geometric principles on the accelerated solid perspective, i.e. an illusory method used for the construction of a physical space tricking the audience with greater depths than there actually are on the stage. Moreover, the students will master the geometry behind the scenic reproduction\nof the sketch: from the two-dimensional painting to the three-dimensional space of the stage, by going on a short journey through the historical phases of scenography from the XVIth century to today and through the acquisition of fundamental concepts of this discipline. This course will finally show how the conscious use of the perspective processes applied to the theatrical scene has led to the stage implementation of three graduation thesis proposals in three famous operas: Aida, Tosca and Madama Butterfly.",

The advent of mobile-focused, touch-based interfaces revolutionized the landscape of interaction design in just a few years. Today, the potential of AR/VR interfaces loom on the horizon. Who can say how we will control technologies in 10 or 15 years?\n\nWhile human/computer interaction evolves, one aspect of this stays refreshingly constant: Humans. Technology will always have users, and those users will always have specific needs if they are to be successful. This course covers everything that goes into finding what users need and satisfying those needs.\n\nWe will cover this process from start to finish - beginning with identifying users and their needs, then finding ways to meet those needs as thoughtfully as possible.\n\nRelease schedule:\nThis course will be released on a rolling release schedule. There are a total of 4 modules in this course, each of which covering a discrete step in the interface design process. Module 0 and 1 will be released when the course goes live, and the remaining modules will be released as follows:\nModule 2: 7/6\nModule 3: 7/13\nModule 4: 7/20",

The four Sessions are:\nSession 1: Micro-course introduction\nThis initial session is designed to develop your self-awareness, skills and confidence in presentation and communication with a range of different audiences. The session includes the crucial task of your recording your \u2018Informing Videos\u2019. These two brief videos form the basic working material for your journey through the remainder of the course.\nSession 2: Personal Presence\nIn Session 2 we start to delve more deeply into who you are \u2013 as an artist and presenter. Using your two Informing Videos, you will explore and analyse the qualities that you bring to your presentation context. You will also turn from inward-looking to outward-looking and examine a TED Talk, to garner more depth of knowledge from a broader range of presentation styles and contexts.",

This micro-course explores the three crucial dimensions of communicating with your audience \u2013 whoever that audience might be - whether interested observers; consumers of, or investors in your art and potentially your career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The course is presented in four (4) Sessions and includes videos and associated documents. The four Sessions are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Session 1: Micro-course introduction&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;This initial session is designed to\ndevelop your self-awareness, skills and confidence in presentation and\ncommunication with a range of different audiences. The session includes the crucial\ntask of your recording your \u2018Informing Videos\u2019. These two brief videos form the\nbasic working material for your journey through the remainder of the course.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Session 2: Personal Presence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Session &lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;2 we start to delve more deeply into who &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; are \u2013 as an artist and presenter. &lt;/span&gt;Using your two Informing Videos, you will explore\nand analyse the qualities that you bring to your presentation context. You will\nalso turn from inward-looking to outward-looking and examine a TED Talk, to garner\nmore depth of knowledge from a broader range of presentation styles and\ncontexts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Session 3: Profiling your audience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;Session 3 is about identifying and\nprofiling your audience.

The German poet Goethe described the quartet in terms of a musical conversation. For the audience, Goethe wrote, a quartet performance is like \u201clistening to four rational people conversing among themselves.\u201d Reflecting aesthetic sensibilities commonly associated with the genre in the Enlightenment age of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, the conversation metaphor nicely captures two defining features of the genre: its intimate, personal nature as well as its capacity to convey profound musical thought through the essential ingredients of four-part harmony and counterpoint. And, as Haydn\u2019s compositions amply demonstrate, the medium of the string quartet can also lend itself to the expression of wit and humor.\n\nThis course, in defining the string quartet in these various ways, pays particular attention to Haydn\u2019s towering, history-shaping achievement. In the first part of the course, after providing some general background on the origins of the medium in the seventeenth and early eighteenth century, we look at some examples of early string quartet writing by Allegri, Scarlatti and early-period Haydn. In the second half, because the very essence of the genre resides in musical detail and nuance, we develop the tools for informed listening and appreciation by presenting an in-depth analysis of a single work, Haydn\u2019s String Quartet in F minor, opus 20, no. 5 from 1772. With frequent musical illustrations by the St. Lawrence Quartet, we explore the F-minor Quartet in terms of three complementary concepts: form, language, and gesture.\n\nIn a concluding section we analyze the final movement, comparing Haydn\u2019s use of the compositional technique known as \u201cfugue\u201d to other fugues by Bach, Handel and Mozart. By means of this \u201clearned style,\u201d we argue, the composer connects his musical language to ecclesiastical traditions, just as the movement\u2019s rhetorical character reflects his penchant for musical effects drawn from the world of opera. The aesthetic spheres of the chamber, church and theater converge. Haydn thus defines his watershed opus \u2014 in microcosm \u2014 as something at once intimate, recondite and playful.",

Study of cover versions at Cavern and Hamburg shows, Please Please Me, With the Beatles, and the singles from this period.\n\nSuccess in America and the World\n-The Beatles begin to move toward the artist model. Music from A Hard Day's Night, Beatles For Sale, and singles from this period. From this point on we will closely follow particular authorship of songs, keeping track of John, Paul, and George as individual songwriters.\n\nPop Maturity\n-Increased experimentation, still mostly within the context of the pop single. The increasingly important role of the recording studio and recording techniques and innovations. Help!, Rubber Soul, and singles from this period.\n\nPsychedelia\n-The artist model comes into full bloom. The rise of importance of the album and idea-driven projects. Revolver, \"Penny Lane,\" \"Strawberry Fields,\" Sgt. Pepper, Magical Mystery Tour, and other singles from this period, including the tracks that would end up on Yellow Submarine.\n\nA Co-Op of Singer-Songwriters\n-The White Album both begins a return to roots while also continuing the musical experimentation of the earlier music, but now each song is less of a group effort. Creative differences arise. The White Album and singles from this period.\n\nGet Back\n-Once there was a way to get back home. The Get Back sessions embrace a return-to-simplicity approach but are aborted. Abbey Road attempts to get back to the band's previous manner of working. Let It Be combines material from Get Back with newly recorded tracks. Abbey Road, Let It Be, and singles from this period.",

Las generaciones que han crecido en un entorno con un desarrollo tecnol\u00f3gico constante han sabido adaptar sus m\u00e9todos de aprendizaje a las nuevas posibilidades que diariamente ofrecen los medios audiovisuales. De esta manera, la difusi\u00f3n y apropiaci\u00f3n del conocimiento a trav\u00e9s de los videos ha adquirido una fuerza sin precedente; por ello, hemos considerado de vital importancia que tanto docentes como alumnos obtengan las habilidades necesarias para realizar videos de calidad.\n\nIntroducci\u00f3n al lenguaje audiovisual\n-Para hacer un buen video, debes pensar en el efecto que tendr\u00e1 sobre los espectadores. Hay varios elementos que pueden generar una diferencia en esto. Necesitas saber lo que suceder\u00e1 si encuadras una toma de una manera o de otra, la forma de utilizar el sonido para ayudar a mostrar lo que est\u00e1 pasando y editar tus tomas para formar una secuencia que transmita el mensaje deseado.

Del mismo modo, hablaremos de la importancia para el m\u00fasico de pensar y escuchar como productor y viceversa. La definici\u00f3n del objetivo emocional ser\u00e1 fundamental no solo en esta lecci\u00f3n, sino a lo largo de todo el proceso de producir una canci\u00f3n. El balance entre lo posible (sue\u00f1o) y lo factible (realidad de nuestro contexto) ser\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n analizado de forma pr\u00e1ctica. Discutiremos algunas consideraciones para lograr una colaboraci\u00f3n exitosa entre m\u00fasicos y productor.\n\nLecci\u00f3n 2: Instinto musical y un flujo de trabajo eficaz\n-Para esta lecci\u00f3n, recalcaremos la importancia de tener una metodolog\u00eda para abordar nuestra producci\u00f3n. Seguidamente, iniciaremos el proceso de capturar las impresiones e instintos iniciales para convertirlos en el objetivo emocional que regir\u00e1 la senda que atravesar\u00e1 nuestra producci\u00f3n. Prepararemos nuestro DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) para este prop\u00f3sito, y trabajaremos con la tonalidad y el tempo de nuestra canci\u00f3n.\n\nLecci\u00f3n 3: C\u00f3mo construir un viaje irresistible para el oyente\n-En esta lecci\u00f3n, definiremos y analizaremos la estructura de nuestra canci\u00f3n, determinando la duraci\u00f3n de cada segmento de la misma. Sopesaremos los pros y los contras de la estructura de la canci\u00f3n, tomando en cuenta la posibilidad de a\u00f1adir o quitar secciones, seg\u00fan lo requiera nuestra situaci\u00f3n particular. Tambi\u00e9n discutiremos la instrumentaci\u00f3n y los arreglos que podr\u00eda llevar nuestro tema, teniendo presente el \u00abnorte\u00bb est\u00e9tico que estamos buscando para \u00e9l.\n\nLecci\u00f3n 4: C\u00f3mo maximizar el contenido musical (Parte 1)\n-Ha llegado el momento de incursionar en la manipulaci\u00f3n de los elementos r\u00edtmicos de la canci\u00f3n. Evaluaremos el contraste entre usar ritmos estables versus ritmos inestables. Asimismo, analizaremos las posibilidades ofrecidas por la subdivisi\u00f3n dentro de estos ritmos y la densidad que resulta como producto de ella. Incidiremos en el impacto emocional producido por la manipulaci\u00f3n de las din\u00e1micas. La armon\u00eda y su abanico de opciones ser\u00e1n tambi\u00e9n discutidos aqu\u00ed. Los Amigos Invisibles nos visitar\u00e1n hacia el final de esta excursi\u00f3n.\n\nLecci\u00f3n 5: C\u00f3mo maximizar el contenido musical (Parte 2)\n-Para esta lecci\u00f3n, nos detendremos y buscaremos ser objetivos, tratando de analizar nuestra producci\u00f3n para determinar si podemos maximizar de alguna forma su impacto emocional. La voz y su rol protag\u00f3nico tendr\u00e1n la atenci\u00f3n que se merecen; el rango mel\u00f3dico y el enfoque emocional de la voz ser\u00e1n discutidos, tratando de buscar la configuraci\u00f3n ideal de ambos para optimizar los resultados emocionales de la producci\u00f3n.\n\nLecci\u00f3n 6: Consejos para el futuro y cierre del curso\n-Al t\u00e9rmino de este curso, compararemos el inicio y el final de nuestro proceso, a forma de evaluaci\u00f3n, de tal manera que podamos ponderar los resultados y la eficacia de nuestra metodolog\u00eda. Compartiremos algunos consejos para poder continuar trabajando en nuestra estrategia despu\u00e9s de este curso. Los Amigos Invisibles cerrar\u00e1n esta fruct\u00edfera jornada.",

        "overview": "Louis Armstrong. Charlie Parker. John Coltrane. You\u2019ve heard their names, but do you know what makes them great? In Jazz Appreciation, you will learn what these artists and many others contributed to America\u2019s great original art form, revered the world over for its innovation and creativity. Jazz emerged during a time of tremendous change and upheaval in American society; this course will also discuss how its evolution both reflected and contributed to those changes.\nMuch more than a lecture series, Jazz Appreciation weaves in musical performances and examples that will deepen your understanding of the musical process and develop your ability to identify and analyze different jazz eras and great jazz soloists. It also incorporates cutting-edge adaptive learning technology that will allow you to practice your new knowledge and skills, at your own pace, until you reach mastery.\nJoin this course to enhance your enjoyment of jazz by developing an informed understanding and deep appreciation of the art.\nPlease note: This course includes a wealth of music. In sensitivity to artists\u2019 rights, course videos including music are available for a limited time only. Materials are released weekly on Saturday mornings, and videos are removed nine days later, on Sunday nights. Please plan to keep pace with the course in order to get the most out of it. \n ",

Particular attention will be paid to musical contributions of leading jazz artists throughout the history of the music.\nTopics for each week are as follows:\nWeek 1 Introduction/How Jazz Works/Jazz History Overview\nWeek 2 Developing Listening Skills: Hard Bop\nWeek 3 Refining Listening Skills: Cool Jazz and Bebop\nWeek 4 Bebop and Swing: The Classic Jazz Eras\nWeek 5 Ellington and the Beginnings\nWeek 6 Louis and Miles\nWeek 7 Miles and 'trane\nWeek 8 'trane, Free Jazz, and Mingus\nWeek 9 Keyboard Giants: Monk, Evans, Hancock, and Corea\nWeek 10 Fusion and Stars of Today\n\nWe believe the study of jazz is incomplete without a variety of musical examples, so our course videos include many short excerpts from important jazz artists and eras, in keeping with fair use principles. We are excited to offer access to videos rich with musical examples that provide a valuable learning experience for students. To balance the artists' rights with the principle of open access to education, most videos will be posted for a limited time.\nAs the course progresses, videos from previous weeks will be replaced with downloadable transcripts of the videos. These transcripts include written information on the musical excerpts discussed. To get the most benefit from the course, please watch the videos as many times as you would like during the following availability schedule:\nLast day to complete all coursework: March 28, 2016\n ",
