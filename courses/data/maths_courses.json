		"overview": "Math is everywhere. In this class, you\u2019ll gain an in-depth understanding of algebraic principles, many of which you may have seen before, and learn how to use them to solve problems that we encounter in everyday life. The online version of College Algebra will cover all of the topics that you would see in more traditional class formats, but it will present the material in a way that we hope you\u2019ll find fresh and interesting. You will learn about functions, polynomials, graphing, complex numbers, exponential and logarithmic equations, and much more, all through exploring real-world scenarios.\n\n\nWhy Take This Course?\nIn this course, you will learn...\nTo translate word problems into mathematical expressions or equations\nTo manipulate algebraic expressions and solve equations\nTo graph different types of functions and to understand the relationship between a function\u2019s graph and its equation\nTo model growth and decay",

		"overview": "How to Learn Math is a class for learners of all levels of mathematics. It combines really important information on the brain and learning with new evidence on the best ways to approach and learn math effectively. Many people have had negative experiences with math, and end up disliking math or failing. This class will give learners of math the information they need to become powerful math learners, it will correct any misconceptions they have about what math is, and it will teach them about their own potential to succeed and the strategies needed to approach math effectively. If you have had past negative experiences with math this will help change your relationship to one that is positive and powerful.\nThe course will feature Jo and a team of undergraduates, as well as videos of math in action - in dance, juggling, snowflakes, soccer and many other applications. It is designed with a pedagogy of active engagement. ",

This session give stunning new evidence on brain growth, and consider what it means for math learners.\n\nMath and Mindset\nWhen individuals change their mindset from fixed to growth their learning potential increases drastically. In this session participants will be encouraged to develop a growth mindset for math.\n\nMistakes and Speed\nRecent brain evidence shows the value of students working on challenging work and even making mistakes. But many students are afraid of mistakes and think it means they are not a math person. This session will encourage students to think positively about mistakes. It will also help debunk myths about math and speed.",

		"overview": "Situations where resources are shared among users appear in a wide variety of domains, from lines at stores and toll booths to queues in telecommunication networks. The management of these shared resources can have direct consequences on users, whether it be waiting times or blocking probabilities. \n\nIn this course, you'll learn how to describe a queuing system statistically, how to model the random evolution of queue lengths over time and calculate key performance indicators, such as an average delay or a loss probability. \n\nThis course is aimed at engineers, students and teachers interested in network planning. \n\nPractical coursework will be carried out using ipython notebooks on a Jupyterhub server which you will be given access to.\n\nStudent testimonial\n\"Great MOOC ! The videos, which are relatively short, provide a good recap on Markov chains and how they apply to queues. The quizzes work well to check if you've understood.\" Lo\u00efc, beta-tester\n\n\"The best MOOC on edX! I'm finishing week 2 and I've never seen that much care put in a course lab! And I love these little gotchas you put into quizzes here and there! Thank you!\" rka444, learner from Session 1, February - March 2018",

		"syllabus": "This is a five week course :\nWeek 1 is an introduction to queuing theory. We will introduce basic notions such as arrivals and departures. Particular attention will be paid to the Poisson process and to exponential distribution, two important particular cases of arrivals and service times.\nDuring week 2 we will analyze a first simple example of a no-loss queue, the so called M/M/1 queue, and we will compute its average performance metrics.\nWeek 3 will be dedicated to a basic course in discrete time Markov chains. We will learn how they are characterized and how to compute their steady-state distribution.\nThen in week 4 we will move on to continuous time Markov chains. Again we will learn how to characterize them and how to analyze their steady-state distribution. Equipped with these tools we will then analyze the M/M/1 queue.\nIn week 5 we will study multiserver and finite capacity queues and study how to dimension a loss network.\nEach week of the course will include five or six video lectures, a quiz to test your understanding of the main concepts introduced during that week and a lab using python.",
