        "syllabus": "Key Beliefs\nLectures during Module One will introduce participants to the Match Teacher Residency's key beliefs around teacher coaching. We will discuss the key variables involved in structuring \"effective\" coaching that results in lasting changes in teacher practice and ultimately more classroom learning. We recommend approaching material by first watching lecture videos and then doing to associated reading. Afterwards, the quiz is a summative assessment that allows you to demonstrate mastery of Module One material.\n\nMindset\nLectures during the Module 2 will introduce students to the first variable in our Effective Coaching Formula, the Fixed Mindset Tax. We draw heavily on the work of psychologist Carol Dweck to frame the extent to which a teacher's mindset can greatly influence the effectiveness of a coaching intervention. Module 2 will offer strategies for overcoming common behaviors associated with fixed mindset, the belief that one cannot improve at a particular skill. We will also demonstrate how combating these behaviors could also help you promote Growth Mindset, the attitude of optimism and investment in improving.\n\nInstructional Vision\nModule 3 explains the second variable in our formula, the Clarity of Instructional Vision -- the extent to which coach and teacher agree on and can communicate effectively about what constitutes excellent instruction. This variable is key in developing common language, goal setting, and maintaining urgency in the coaching context. While there are numerous philosophies for what excellent instruction looks like, this week will also introduce participants to the Match Teacher Residency's \"student-facing\" vision for optimal classroom culture. Before watching \"The Kraken,\" click to the readings page to download a PDF of our rubric as a viewing guide.\n\n\nModule 4 lectures dive deep on the final variable in our formula, Quality of Feedback. During this module, participants will learn how to structure a highly effective coaching meeting, based on the protocol used by instructional coaches at the Match Teacher Residency. Before watching the second video this week, pause to download our Coaching Session template from the readings page. You can use it as a viewing guide while you watch \"The Coaching Session.\"\n\n\nFinal exam time! You've learned a lot about how to facilitate effective teacher coaching, and now it's time to show what you know. You can find the rubric for the assignment on the readings page. When you've familiarized yourself with the parameters of the assignment, click on this week's lecture video, which you will use to complete the assignment.",

You can undertake the six country sessions in any order you\u2019d like. Through this course we aim to: *Give you an insight into how social pedagogy has been developing across Europe, highlighting both the diversity and connections, *Highlight the importance of valuing every person as intrinsically \u2018rich\u2019, recognising their unique potential and ability to be a valuable member of society, *Introduce you to ways in which you can bring this belief to life in everyday interactions and relationships that support people\u2019s learning, nurture their well-being and enable them to feel included in society, *Ensure you are familiar with the most fundamental aspects of social pedagogical practice in ways that are applicable in your own personal and professional life. Please watch our introductory video to get more insights.\n\nIntroduction to Social Pedagogy across Europe and Participatory Practice\n-In the first session, you\u2019ll hear from our ThemPra team how social pedagogy has been developing across Europe and what the central guiding principles are. We\u2019ll also tell you more about the social pedagogy perspective we\u2019re taking in the MOOC and what themes we\u2019ll be covering over the course. Finally, we\u2019ll dive straight into the first theme: participatory practice. You\u2019ll have a chance to find out why participation is important and how you can ensure that the people you support are meaningfully involved in decisions that affect them. Find out more about the first session in the short intro video below.\n\nSocial Pedagogy in Germany - Resource-Orientated Practice\n-Our first country session will take you to the \u2018cradle\u2019 of social pedagogy: Germany. In this session by our colleagues from the KJSH in Northern Germany, we\u2019ll first give you an overview of social pedagogy in Germany, and then highlight the dynamics at play in social pedagogical practice, before introducing you to ways of working with, and strengthening, people\u2019s resourcefulness. We\u2019ve included six videos and two case studies about resource-orientated case management at the KJSH. Please watch our short intro video for more details.\n\nSocial Pedagogy in the UK \u2013 Creativity\n-In this week\u2019s first session you\u2019ll meet our colleagues at the University of Central Lancashire, who will introduce you to social pedagogy in the UK. In particular, we\u2019ll focus on the role of creativity in social pedagogical practice. Our session includes ten short videos and a choice between two creative activities you can do as part of your assignment. Please watch our short intro video for more details.\n\nSocial Pedagogy in Denmark \u2013 Purposeful Shared Activities\n-The second session this week features the Danish contribution from our teams at K\u00f8benhavns Professionsh\u00f8jskole and Common View. In this session we\u2019ll introduce you to social pedagogy in Denmark and a model for planning purposeful shared activities: SMTTE. We use this a lot in Denmark as we love undertaking activities together with the people we support social pedagogically. Please watch our short intro video for more details about our session.\n\nSocial Pedagogy in the Czech Republic \u2013 Prevention\n-The first session of this week comes from our colleagues at Masaryk University in the Czech Republic. As you\u2019ll learn, social pedagogy has a long history and a very interesting tradition there. We\u2019ll also explore how prevention activities can be used within social pedagogical practice and why these are important. Our session includes four videos and several further resources on prevention programmes in the Czech Republic. Please watch our short intro video for further details.\n\nSocial Pedagogy in Spain - Community Education\n-In this week\u2019s second session we\u2019ll introduce you to social pedagogy in Spain. Our team from Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona is pleased to explore with you the history and current situation of social pedagogy in Spain and the role of community education within this framework. We\u2019ve included a total of sixteen videos aimed at giving you a comprehensive and practice-relevant insight into the role that community education plays within community life and the education of individuals. Please watch our short intro video for further details about our session.\n\nSocial Pedagogy in Belgium \u2013 Social Justice\n-In this session we\u2019ll be exploring with you the role of social pedagogy as a perspective in Belgium. We\u2019ll also introduce you to aspects around social justice and how social pedagogues can engage with people who are disadvantaged because of social inequality, given that we won't be able to solve complex structural problems like poverty. Over our 4 videos, we\u2019ll also share some practice insights illustrating how we can \u2018keep the door open\u2019 to ensure we engage with those wider issues. Please watch our short intro video, in which we outline our session in more detail.\n\nSocial Pedagogy in a Wider Context\n-In this second session we\u2019ll briefly be reviewing the key learning points from the previous sessions and encouraging you to revisit your reflections from earlier sessions. But we don\u2019t stop there. We\u2019ve also included a glimpse at social pedagogy across the globe with short contributions illustrating social pedagogical practices in Mexico, Greece, the United States, Canada, Brazil and Slovakia. You\u2019ll also find some practical tips on how you can nurture change and develop some of the ideas you've been learning about in your team and wider organisation.

This course is aimed to introduce the essentials of facilitation of student learning (\u2018teaching\u2019) in an interesting way to any teacher of professional courses, with a special focus on engineering. Further, education is a vast, old area of research, with rigorous, evidence-based knowledge that is useful for the facilitation of learning. However, the knowledge is not in an easily accessible form for teachers without experience in education research. This course also aims to begin bridging that gap, by appropriately introducing research in education to engineering teachers.",

The module also considers issues of data access, privacy, and the challenges raised by \u2018big data\u2019 including data persistency and student profiling. A final section addresses the processes of educational evaluation. Video presenters include Mary Kalantzis, Bill Cope, Luc Paquette, and Jennifer Greene.\n\nKinds of Assessments\n-The word \"standard\" is used in two quite different ways in testing theory and practice: to create a common measure of learning in \"standardized assessments\"; and the generalized and measurable objectives of learning. Sometimes standardized assessments are used to determine the outcomes of standards-based education, but often not. Standards-based assessment can also be criterion-referenced, and self-referenced.\n\nNew Assessments in the Digital Age\n-Computer-mediated assessments can be used to mechanize, and so make more efficient, traditional select-and-supply response assessments. However, new opportunities also present themselves in the form of technologies and assessment processes called \"learning analytics.\"\n\nEducational Data Mining + Evaluation\n-In this module, Luc Paquette discusses educational data mining \u2013 a new generation of techniques with which to analyze student learning for the purposes of assessment, evaluation, and research. Finally, Jennifer Greene explores theories and practices of evaluation. Assessment data may be used to support evaluations, however evaluation is a considerably broader process.",

In this short module you will get the chance to know the instructors who will help you learn and understand LGBTQ+ issues in education. We hope you enjoy in taking this course as much as we enjoyed creating it.\n\nAllyship and Advocacy\n-In this module, we\u2019re going to explore three concepts: allies, accomplices, and advocates. People use these three words to talk about the kinds of actions they want to see from others who want to act on their behalf. Although this module focuses specifically on what it means to be an ally for LGBTQ+ people, many of the ideas we\u2019ll work with here apply to being an ally for other marginalized people and communities. This module will prepare you to talk about allyship, advocacy, and accomplices, as well as to support LGBTQ+ people through your words and actions.\n\nLGBTQ+ Experiences in Schools\n-In this module, we will briefly discuss the history of LGBTQ+ experiences in school. Then, we will examine some statistics to understand the current state of LGBTQ+ experiences of school. Finally, we will learn how to frame problems that LGBTQ+ students face in a way that supports school-wide solutions.\n\nShowing up for LGBTQ+ Students: Five Strategies\n-In this module, we will walk through some very specific strategies you can use to help make your school more inclusive. The four strategies we will cover in this module are: Ask for and use correct pronouns and names; Start or support a GSA or other school organization; Learn about school policies; and Keep learning locally and generally.\n\nCurriculum Development for Inclusion\n-In this module, we\u2019ll explore and apply strategies for evaluating curricular materials. We will also be refining them to make them more inclusive of LGBTQ+ identities and experiences.\n\nYour Future as an LGBTQ+ Inclusive Educator\n-In this module, you\u2019ll start planning your next steps as an LGBTQ+-inclusive educator. We want you to think of this work as a kind of personalized research project. You\u2019ve decided to make some changes to your curriculum. Now you need to gather information about how effective those changes are. That information can help you decide what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not. It can also help you as you talk with colleagues, parents, students, and community members about the work you\u2019re doing.",

        "syllabus": "Welcome! Introduce Yourself!\nWelcome to the first week of LearnToMod for Educators! This is going to be an exciting, self-paced course where you will get an introduction to the popular world of Minecraft through the context of teaching programming. This course is meant to be very hands on, as the best way to learn how to program AND how to play Minecraft is to do it! What this means is that there won't be a lot of lectures from us; instead, we will start you off and you will explore the software and assignments on your own. Through this course, you will not only gain your own programming and Minecraft skills, but also learn effective ways to engage your students in programming topics. In this module, we introduce you to the importance of programming in every student's career, and ask you to introduce yourself to the rest of the class!\n\nExploring Minecraft and LearnToMod for Education\nNow is the time to get excited! In this module you will get an introduction to the two pieces of software that you are going to be using, Minecraft and LearnToMod! The goal of the first set of lessons in this module is to familiarize yourself with Minecraft and the reasons why it is such a popular game for players as well as educators. In the second set of modules, you'll be introduced to the interactive LearnToMod software. The great part about this software is that you can use it with or without Minecraft! We have built an in-browser IDE so you do not need to purchase Minecraft to be able to use it yourself, or with your students!\n\n\nThis is an optional module for those of you interested in using the LearnToMod software with actual Minecraft (as well as just playing Minecraft). You have two options - purchasing Minecraft, or trying it out for the 30-day free trial. If you decide to purchase it, make sure you only buy the version available for the PC or Mac; the LearnToMod software is not compatible with the Pocket Edition, the Windows 10 Edition, or any other versions of the game on gaming consoles or set-top boxes. Furthermore, you are encouraged to watch these accompanying videos even if you are not planning on purchasing Minecraft, just to get a better idea of the gameplay and experience.\n\n\nNow that you are familiar with the LearnToMod software a little, here's your chance to learn some programming and test it out in our Minecraft Simulator, or in Minecraft! This module will guide you through the Learner Focused part of the software, the badge system. Badges are \"micro programming assignments\" that introduce programming and Minecraft topics like iteration, conditional statements, and variables. The way we guide you through this module is similar to how I could guide my students! At the end of this module, you are asked to complete at least 40 badges in the LearnToMod software. Feel free to ask questions on the Help Forum. We recommend reading the Peer Review Assignment before earning all 40 badges, so that you can better understand your goals. HAPPY MODDING!\n\n\nCongratulations! You are officially a LearnToMod Minecraft Modder! How exciting! This is actually a huge feat; even though the LearnToMod software guides you through a safe environment, you have just learned the basics of programming! In this module, you will get a chance to play around with different ways of teaching programming using the LearnToMod software. We recognize that your interests, teaching styles, and students are varied and diverse and, while we provide you with some example lesson plans, activities, and rubrics, we encourage you to personalize what you learn in this course when you bring it back to the classroom. So in this module you will also have a chance to do that, and to give and get feedback from your classmates!\n\n\nNow that you are an official LearnToMod Minecraft Modder, and you have reviewed and written your own LearnToMod Lesson Plans and Classroom Activities, you can officially say you are a LearnToMod Educator! CONGRATULATIONS! As you go out and begin teaching, we want to make sure that you never lose your support from this large and growing community. We encourage you to come back to this course, to this module, and share your experiences, give advice, and see new updates to the software and curriculum that is available to you! Learning and Teaching is a lifelong experience, and we are so glad that you have taken the first step in this specific topic with us!",

What are the effects of adjusting teacher salaries to be based on their performance in the classroom? When should teachers be given tenure? Do current policies encourage or discourage effective teachers from entering the profession?\nMany questions come down to budgetary constraints. Should you hire more teachers so you have smaller classes? Should it be a priority to balance how much is spent between wealthy and poor districts?\nThroughout this mini-course, we will be focused on using empirical evidence to answer these questions.\nThis mini-course contains six lectures, with most lectures divided into three videos. The mini-courses also include assigned readings, discussion forums, and assessments.\nThis is the second mini-course in a four-course sequence.",

        "overview": "##\nCurrently there are many modalities of schooling for students with autism, including general special schools, autism-specific special schools, autism units within mainstream schools and being in a mainstream classroom.\nBut what are the benefits and challenges of these different types of education? What are the implications for inclusion? What constitutes good practice within autism education? These questions are addressed in this course and are crucial for enabling children on the autism spectrum to be educated to their greatest potential.\nThe primary target audience are those who work with autistic children in schools, such as teachers and teaching assistants. However all practitioners can benefit (eg speech and language therapists). The target age range is compulsory education (4-18 years). The course will also be of benefit to interested parents of autistic children, as well as the autistic community themselves.\nThe European Commission support for the production of this publication does not constitute an endorsement of the contents which reflects the views only of the authors, and the Commission cannot be held responsible for any use which may be made of the information contained therein.",

        "syllabus": "The role of assessment in higher education\n-In the first week of this course you\u2019ll get insight in some basic but fundamental questions about assessment. Why do we assess in higher education? What are possible positive and negative effects of assessment? And in what way can we make an effort in choosing the most appropriate assessment method(s). Some leading experts on assessment are introduced to you and might enlighten your thoughts. Additionally, you will be introduced to the Utility formula, which will assist you in making purposeful assessment choices.\n\nThe Assessment Cycle\n\nThe Assessment Plan\n-As research shows, assessment plays an important role in steering the learning process. There is, however, not one best method of assessment. So, how can you select the right methods of assessments for your course? Making an assessment plan can help you select the right testing methods and decide on the relative weight of each assessment for the final result of a course. An assessment plan also helps to ensure that the assessment addresses the intended learning outcomes. In addition, it provides a good overview of the test arrangement for a course that will be published in the course manual. This makes an assessment plan a helpful tool for examiners and an important instrument for quality assurance. With an assessment matrix, you ensure that all the selected learning objectives are covered in your assessment. This also helps to ensure that your assessment will be both valid and reliable.\nWhereas making an assessment matrix may feel like additional work, using it will actually save you time as you will develop questions and assignments that exactly match your learning objectives and you avoid the risk of formulating too many questions that are aimed at the same content or skill.\n\n\nFeedback & grading design\n-In module 1 you have learned about assessment FOR learning and the role assessments play in the learning process of students. In this module we will take this to the next step. You will learn why feedback is so important and how to provide feedback using rubrics. Did you know there are different types of rubrics? Depending on the function of the rubric each type has both its advantages and disadvantages. This module will help you deciding what type of rubric suits your needs. In the stage of grading, methods of setting a cut-off score are important. You will learn about different methods of setting a cut-off score and the advantages and disadvantages of these methods.\n\nAssessment construction\n-The results of student assessments often have far-reaching consequences for their educational or even professional careers. When we allow our assessments to have such impacts on people\u2019s careers, it is of the utmost importance that we are very sure that our measurement is reliable and accurate and a valid representation of students\u2019 actual abilities\u2026. Unfortunately, that is not always the case. The goal for this module is to help you to apply quality criteria for the construction of assessments and assessment items. Because, if we improve the quality of our assessments, we improve the quality of our education, and we will have a huge impact on the future education and careers of our students.\n\nAssessment Analysis and Evaluation\n-When an assessment has been conducted, there is often a lot of time pressure on grading and publishing the results. However, an important step to take before communicating grades to students is to analyse students\u2019 performance on the different tasks or questions. This will provide you, as an examiner, with invaluable information. Not only about your students\u2019 performance, but also about the quality of your assessment as well as your own teaching. On which aspects did students perform well, and where did they fail? If good students fail on certain questions, what does this say about the question\u2026 or about your teaching? You may need to decide on how to fix certain errors or unexpected situations and think about how this affects students\u2019 grades. What are the things to consider when performing an exam or item analysis? What do you look for? How do you draw conclusions and make plans for future improvements?",

Marble Machines are creative ball-run contraptions made from familiar materials. This week we will show you the activity in action, talk about its design, then discuss in detail how to build your own Marble Machines set. We also hear from the artist who inspired the activity, and Eleanor Duckworth will share her pedagogical perspective.\n\nCARDBOARD AUTOMATA\n-This week, we turn our attention to Cardboard Automata: inspired by crank-operated mechanical devices that tell miniature stories with movement and narrative, these simple but engaging contraptions are often a vehicle for personal expression and humor.\n\nChain Reaction\n-A Chain Reaction machine is a deceptively simple concept, but one that allows for an incredibly complex and deep investigation into something we experience every day: the relationship between cause and effect. It brings all of a tinkerer\u2019s skills to bear to improvise, build, troubleshoot, and imagine a problem and its solution!\n\nResearch + Practice\n-This week is dedicated to exploring the relationship between practice and research about learning through tinkering.",

Come si applica il diritto d\u2019autore nella formazione e alle opere digitali nella didattica? Come rispettare la norma e quali sono le eccezioni e le possibili violazioni? Quali differenze ci sono tra analogico e digitale rispetto a tali temi? Queste sono alcune delle domande alle quali cercheremo di rispondere durante questo corso.Il corso si sviluppa nell\u2019arco di due settimane, la seconda settimana di ogni sezione \u00e8 dedicata ad affrontare la prova finale, ma resta aperto sino al termine dell\u2019intero percorso Didatech. Il corso \u00e8 rivolto a educatori e insegnanti in ambito accademico dell\u2019Universit\u00e0 di Parma e di altri Atenei italiani.

        "overview": "This is a hands-on workshop that explores various strategies that middle and high school teachers can use to integrate engineering practices into science lessons and laboratory investigations that they already do. We will start by comparing and contrasting the research methods employed by scientists and engineers, then demonstrate ways that teachers can facilitate, sequence, and assess lessons designed to help students understand and apply engineering principles. These principles include learning to (1) design within constraints, (2) analyze and interpret data, (3) construct models, and (4) conduct iterative tests. Upon completing this course, teachers will possess a deeper understanding of engineering and be able to effectively teach engineering processes to their students.",

We'll look at some famous engineering failures (and successes) and explore teaching applications.\n\nWeek Two: Science and Engineering Thinking\nThe Next Generation Science Standards explicitly call out the differences between science and engineering. We'll use exhibits from the Exploratorium museum floor to illustrate some of these differences, and ask you to re-imagine your own science activity from an engineering perspective.\n\nWeek Three: Modeling Activities\nA hallmark of the Exploratorium Teacher Institute is that we have developed lots of \"snacks\" over the years: hands-on teaching activities (thoroughly tested by students and teachers) that explore scientific phenomena using easy-to-obtain materials. This week, we'll share some of our favorites and ask you to try them out at home.\n\nWeek Four: Develop Your Own Engineering Activity\nIt's your turn! Take what you've learned in the class and create your own mini-lesson. You can adapt one of our activities or come up with your own and get feedback and tips from other students in the class.",

At the end of the course, teachers should be able to design lessons that focus on a range of digital skills, make use of innovative tools to assist their own and the students\u2019 work in this area.\n\nThe course is organized around thematic areas of digital skills that are relevant at all levels of primary and secondary schooling. In 6 modules it explores the definition and role of digital skills generally and then looks at specific skill areas and how to address them in the classroom. The focus of these modules is on how pedagogically the skill area can be addressed and what tools there are available to help the teachers and students.\n\nAt the end of the course participants are required to prepare a final lesson project which can be submitted as part of the eSkills for Jobs Awards competition.

In 6 modules it explores the definition and role of digital skills generally and then looks at specific skill areas and how to address them in the classroom. The focus of these modules is on how pedagogically the skill area can be addressed and what tools there are available to help the teachers and students.\n\nAt the end of the course participants are required to prepare a final lesson project which can be submitted as part of the eSkills for Jobs Awards competition. The course is part of the eSkills 4 Jobs campaign by the European Commission where you can also find additional resources about the topi",

Este es el segundo curso del programa especializado Educaci\u00f3n Matem\u00e1tica para profesores de primaria, ofrecido por la Universidad de los Andes. En este curso, conocer\u00e1s diversas cuestiones sobre el aprendizaje de los temas de las matem\u00e1ticas escolares: objetivos de aprendizaje, etapas de aprendizaje, errores en los que los escolares pueden incurrir y las dificultades que los originan.Antes de tomar este curso, te sugerimos que realices el primer curso del programa Contenido de las matem\u00e1ticas de primaria.\n\nAprendizaje del n\u00famero natural y de los sistemas de numeraci\u00f3n\n-En este m\u00f3dulo, abordamos dos aspectos relacionados con el aprendizaje del n\u00famero natural: las dificultades a las que se enfrentan los escolares y las habilidades que desarrollan a lo largo de la etapa primaria.\n\nAprendizaje de las operaciones aritm\u00e9ticas\n-En este m\u00f3dulo, abordamos tres aspectos relacionados con las operaciones aritm\u00e9ticas: las fases en las que se da su aprendizaje, las estructuras en las que se agrupan y las dificultades a las que se enfrentan los escolares durante su aprendizaje.\n\nAprendizaje de los n\u00fameros racionales y sus operaciones\n-En este m\u00f3dulo, describimos las expectativas de aprendizaje que se espera los escolares desarrollen sobre los n\u00fameros racionales. Mostramos diferentes momentos en los que se desarrollan los significados de los n\u00fameros racionales de fracci\u00f3n como parte todo y de raz\u00f3n, adem\u00e1s de las dificultades y errores que se dan en el aprendizaje de los n\u00fameros racionales.\n\nAprendizaje de la geometr\u00eda\n-En este m\u00f3dulo, describimos el sentido espacial a partir de dos componentes: el manejo de conceptos geom\u00e9tricos y las destrezas para visualizar. Presentamos algunas ideas sobre c\u00f3mo evoluciona el desarrollo de algunas facetas del sentido espacial y las dificultades y errores frecuentes en el aprendizaje de la geometr\u00eda en primaria.\n\nAprendizaje de las magnitudes y su medida\n-En este m\u00f3dulo, explicamos en qu\u00e9 consiste el pensamiento m\u00e9trico y caracterizamos lo que se entiende por sentido de la medida. Profundizamos en el aprendizaje de cuatro magnitudes esenciales en la educaci\u00f3n b\u00e1sica primaria, la longitud, la superficie, la capacidad y el volumen. Mostramos las dificultades m\u00e1s habituales en el aprendizaje de la medida en Primaria, as\u00ed como los errores m\u00e1s frecuentes.\n\nAplicaci\u00f3n de los conceptos aprendidos\n-En esta actividad pondr\u00e1s en juego las siguientes ideas clave sobre el aprendizaje de las matem\u00e1ticas de primaria que se han abordado en el curso: los usos del n\u00famero, las operaciones aditivas y multiplicativas de los n\u00fameros naturales, las representaciones, los significados y operaciones con n\u00fameros racionales, la capacidad, y la estimaci\u00f3n.",

However, although the basic raw material is the reasoning, it is exaggerated in the proliferation of proposals in multiple ways, coupled with restricted vision of the potential of the human brain. We are firm in the belief that intelligence is developed as universal knowledge, and a reconstruction of education and cognitive approaches that support them in order to promote sustained growth and strengthening is needed.\nUnfortunately, its impact on the daily practice demonstrates that every day we depend more on new proposals for the solution of problems, which are costly to be implemented in companies that face. Such is the case of Reasoning or Disruptive Thinking, or CPS Creative Problem Solving.\nThat is why we consider it urgent that the educational models consider the need to train students in this line, and in the case of companies or institutions, reflect on this issue.\nMIRM competitive advantages are:\n1.

Suddenly, the camera shifts to her life before she was given the chance to get an education, a life picking trash. How did she get from the dump to dance?\nEducated girls are 50 percent more likely to immunize their children in the future. With an additional year of education, a girl can earn up to 20 percent more as an adult. A child born to a literate mother is 50 percent more likely to survive past the age of five.\nThis course will focus on four themes directly related to the education of girls worldwide: (1) access and equity, (2) public health, (3) education in emergencies, and (4) empowerment. We will examine (a) research: the data around the education of girls, as well as analyses, images, and stories; (b) relationship: how new learning about girls\u2019 education relates to our practice; and (c) results: the capacity to make a measurable difference in and for our classrooms, our communities, and the world.",

Which stakeholders influence that decision? What factors determine the success or failure of educational technology initiatives? How do we determine if these implementations are successful? \nThis course provides a practical overview for selecting, integrating, implementing, and evaluating educational technology initiatives in formal educational settings, primarily in the US. It will include the perspectives of stakeholders that make such initiatives possible, and consider how to evaluate for efficacy. The audience for this course includes current and future teachers, entrepreneurs, developers, practitioners, and leaders in educational technology. \nThrough four units over seven weeks, participants will develop an awareness and understanding of the \u201cecosystem\u201d surrounding the implementation of educational technology in a formal educational setting.

        "overview": "More and more teachers in Europe face the challenge of how to integrate students with special needs in their mainstream class. This is partly the outcome of a general trend towards accommodating children with special needs in mainstream schools rather than in special school settings. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, signed by all Member States of the European Union, articulates the right of students with special needs to be taught in mainstream education. While this trend is a very welcome and necessary move towards more inclusive education systems, it does provide new challenges to teachers that need to teach more diverse classrooms with more learners with particular needs.\nAs an overall goal, the Supporting Special Educational Needs in Every Classroom course aims at providing teachers a better understanding of the topic and shows how with simple changes teachers can make their teaching and their classroom more inclusive. Furthermore, it aims to help teachers to identify strategies to get the additional support they need. To that end, course participants will be encouraged to share their knowledge and experiences in order to develop a learning network of peers in similar situations to them.\nJoin us on this unique course at the Teacher Academy and meet colleagues in similar situations, reflect about your own practice, find useful resources and ideas to help you reach all learners\u2019 needs, learn about innovative tools that can make your life a lot easier, get inspired and earn  and a  recognising your work!",

Yet in the world of work, people hire and promote based on character as much as on formal qualifications.\nThrough examining what should be experienced by young women in the classroom this course aims to start a conversation between teachers about how to best help girls succeed in the classroom and beyond, as well as offering authoritative advice, guidance and practical solutions.\nUnderstand the factors that affect girls at school\nBefore exploring teaching strategies that work in the classroom, we will first examine the significant factors that influence girls\u2019 learning experiences. In particular we\u2019ll look at the strategies that develop character in a way that supports academic success in school and professional success after school. We will also examine and discuss the factors that can inhibit girls reaching their full potential in school and in their future careers.",

Examines social-cultural theories of difference, as well as considering alternative responses to these differences in educational settings - ranging from broad, institutional responses to specific pedagogical responses within classes of students. The course also focuses on the application of learning technologies and new media to meet the needs of diverse populations of learners. Its main practical question is, how do we use educational technologies to create learning environments in which learning experiences can be customized and calibrated to meet the precise needs of particular learners? Topics include: universal design for learning, differentiated instruction systems, and adaptive and personalized learning environments.",

To learn more about the computation and computing concepts that underlie the technologies using that data? We'll be using a problem-based approach to explore interesting ways to teach concepts of networks and the internet, data and analysis, and even algorithms and data representation. Finally, we'll read a chapter from a children's fiction book -- \"The Secret Code Menace\" and identify some computer science learning outcomes for that chapter.\n\nData Collection\n-Why is it that when you are shopping for an item on one website, you start seeing ads for it other in other places? How do websites know (and quite well) what products and services to recommend their customers and users? We'll look at how the internet has evolved to personalize people's experiences while online. Then to finish up this week, we will learn about how cookies and web servers work, as well as how HTTPS keeps connections secure.\n\nData Privacy\n-This week we'll look at aspects of our personal data such as -- when we we do not want it used, how we can keep it safe, and what control we have. In this Technology Exploration, we'll learn about ciphers, hashing, cryptography, and encryption. Also, do you know the difference between the \"deep\" web and the \"dark\" web? (You will know by the end of this week!)\n\nData Use\n-So far we have learned about data collection and privacy. Now we will spend the week covering some ways that data is used, so we must introduce big data. Along with our exploration of this progressive concept, we will help you connect the use of big data to machine learning though an activity designed to guide your understanding in a fun way!\n\nImpacts of Computing and Pedagogy\n-Next we'll let you choose what you want to explore around \"impacts of computing\" for the technologies we've explored in this world. Along with that, we'll introduce another \"Formative Classroom Assessment Technique\" (FACT) and have you practice how you would use this in the classroom. For our pedagogical focus, we'll look at how retrieval practice helps you learn far more effectively than \"re-studying\" and how to define the learning objectives for a given learning activity using Bloom's taxonomy. Finally, you'll get to read a short chapter from a children's fiction book \"The Secret Code Menace\" and identify for yourself what kids can learn from reading it!",

Globally, ambitious instruction sits at the very center of policy-driven educational improvement efforts, with schools and systems pressed to engage students in \"deeper learning\" and the development of \"21st-century skills.\"\nThis course is both for individual leaders and for teams of leaders from a school, district/region, or system who aim to improve educational opportunities and outcomes for students, especially those historically underserved by public schools. For these teams, the course will function as a platform both for initiating their joint practice and for collaborating on issues that arise in their joint practice.",

In fact, complex writing styles can obscure meaning and tire your readers.\n\nThis short course is aimed at students at tertiary institutions, and contributors to academic publications. It will help you to articulate complex ideas with clarity and meaning.\n\nThe first week of the course focuses on developing a structured writing process, appropriate for your intended readership. We discuss when to write, the importance of a golden thread, the main principles of drafting a research report, and different abstract patterns.\n\nThe second week zooms in on the principles of paragraph and sentence construction. You will learn ways of writing that enhance clarity and engage your readers.",

        "syllabus": "The Aims of Literacy\n-This module explores the notion of \"literacies\" in the plural, and in particular the concept of \"Multiliteracies\" coined by the presenters in this course as part of the New London Group. Literacy in the singular consists of the rigid rules of official standard languages, and is purely grounded in written text. Literacies in the plural, or multiliteracies, acknowledges that language use will vary greatly from one cultural and social context to another, and that contemporary communication is increasingly multimodal, where written text is juxtaposed with, or supplemented by, image, sound, space, object, gesture, and speech. The module goes on to explore the evolution of human communication, and the patterns of communication in today's work, public, and community settings.\n\nTheory and Practice of Literacies Learning and Teaching\n-In this module, we discuss the nature of pedagogy as the conscious design of learning activities. We introduce the idea of \"knowledge processes\" or activity types: experiential, conceptual, critical, and applied. In the case of literacies learning, experiential knowledge processes involve immersion in familiar and new texts. Conceptual knowledge processes include naming of the features of text, and developing theories of how these texts work to serve meaningful purposes. Analytical knowledge processes explore the contexts and purposes of texts. Applied knowledge processes engage learners in the creation of texts.\n\nDidactic + Authentic Approaches to Literacy\n-This module begins with an overview of the range of activity types that might be found in literacies pedagogy. These are illustrated with some examples of literacies learning modules. It goes on to examine two major models of literacy pedagogy: didactic and authentic.\n\nFunctional + Critical Approaches to Literacy\n-Now we explore the remaining two of the four major traditions in literacy teaching and learning: functional and critical approaches to literacy. Our purpose in introducing these four major approaches has been to explore the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, as well as to advocate for the idea that literacy teaching and learning ideally involves a repertoire of different kinds of pedagogical moves or activity types.",

        "overview": "Negli ultimi anni le tecnologie digitali sono state promosse come competenze necessarie per tutti i cittadini. Il mondo della formazione si \u00e8 concentrato molto su concetti come il pensiero computazionale, il pensiero algoritmico, la robotica. Il coding \u00e8 un'attivit\u00e0 che sottende tutti questi aspetti. La maggior parte delle agenzie di formazione dei vari paesi hanno preso iniziative in merito.\nQuesto corso concerne l'uso di un linguaggio di programmazione per la scuola che all'inizio consente al principiante di muovere facilmente i primi passi ma, via via che le sue competenze progrediscono, consente di risolvere problemi progressivamente pi\u00f9 complessi. Nel corso si impiegano strumenti che si basano su software libero, ponendo l'enfasi sulle implicazioni etiche che l'uso di tali programmi comporta, sia come strumenti didattici in s\u00e9 sia come insegnamento diretto di collaborazione e condivisione ai partecipanti. Si tratta di LibreLogo, una particolare versione del linguaggio Logo. Il sistema consente di inserire grafiche all'interno di un documento LibreOffice scrivendo  direttamente le istruzioni di programmazione dentro al documento stesso. In tal modo un semplice documento di testo si trasforma in un laboratorio grafico e non solo dove i limiti sono posti solo dalla propria fantasia. \nLe attivit\u00e0 proposte sono articolate principalmente come sostegno all'apprendimento della matematica, ma anche delle arti e della grammatica. Vengono forniti sia approfondimenti teorici che esempi pratici. Oltre a prime esperienze di programmazione, si propongono elaborazioni matematiche, simulazioni del comportamento animale, riproduzione di crescite vegetali mediante frattali, problem-solving nel campo della fisica. \nIl corso si rivolge ad una vasta gamma di utenti, dalla scuola primaria al livello di istruzione superiore, ponendo in risalto la potenziale dimensione verticale del linguaggio proposto. In particolare modo in varie circostanze si evidenzia tale dimensione verticale mostrando come alcune idee matematiche fondamentali sottendano sia esercizi appropriati per l'introduzione di concreti di base a livello di scuola primaria che esercizi che possono essere proposti nei primi anni dei corsi universitari.\n***\nIn the past few years, digital technologies have become an essential resource in\neveryday life. Education is now focusing on computational thinking, algorithmic thinking and robotics: coding is what makes this all happen and is now being taught in many countries. In this course, the students will learn a programming language for school allowing them to go from \u201cbeginners\u201d to \u201cexperts\u201d. We will use Libero software-based tolls and together, we will discover the ethics implied in similar programs, both as didactic instruments and as direct teachings of collaboration and sharing to all participants.\nIn particular, we will employ LibreLogo, a specific version of the Logo language which allows the users to insert graphics into a LibreOffice document by writing\nthe programming instruction in the document itself. In this way, a simple text  document will turn into a graphic laboratory where you can express your\ncreativity. All the activities proposed here aim at supporting the users in the study of\nmaths, arts and grammar and will be enriched with detailed theoretical sections and practical examples. Moreover, the students will perform their first programming exercises as well as mathematical elaborations, animal behavior simulations, plant growth reproductions with fractals and problem-solving in the field of physics.\nThis course addresses students of all levels, from elementary school onwards,\nand focuses on the potential vertical dimension of the language proposed so as\nto prove that some of the fundamental mathematical ideas can be applied to all levels\nof education.",

We'll be using a problem-based approach to explore interesting ways to teach concepts of networks and the internet, data and analysis, and even algorithms and data representation. Finally, we'll evaluate, critique and improve/personalize two lesson plans -- one of your choice and one on pixels. Specifically, we'll be looking to improve these lesson plans by increasing the amount of interactive learning time for students.\n\nKeeping Connected in a Global Society\n-How has your ability to connect with friends and family changed since social media has become so ubiquitous? What different groups of people are you connected to? Besides looking at the impact of social media on our lives and society, we'll also take a detailed look at the history and development of the Facebook newsfeed algorithm -- learning a bit about software engineering , user experience, and heuristics. From interacting with a Facebook visualization tool we'll be curious to investigate what causes programs to take a long time to run and how computer scientists categorize how long it will take for programs to run.\n\nMaking Geography-based Connections\n-With so much more knowledge being collected about our physical location, we have new ways we can find friends and support relationships among those \"close\" to us. We'll look at several apps that leverage this and dive into digital image representations needed to support filters like those found in Snapchat.\n\nImpacts of Computing and Supporting Interactive Learning\n-This week we'll introduce the Computer Science K-12 Framework and the Computer Science Teachers Association K-12 Computer Science Standards which are starting to frame state K-12 Computer Science standards in the US. We'll guide you in finding and developing a lesson plan for a particular grade band around a resource for learning about the impact of technology on culture. Next we'll learn a bit about further differentiating and defining \"active learning\" using the ICAP (interactive, constructive, active, passive) learning framework and see how Peer Instruction can be used to scaffold interactive learning experiences.\n\nMore lesson plans for interactivity: Impacts and Encoding Images\n-This week is all about giving you the time and excuse to develop lesson plans you can use (and/or share with colleagues!) We'll be improving lesson plans (including the one you created last week) to increase the amount of \"interactive\" learning in them. Additionally, we'll try to align these lessons with CSTA standards -- recognizing that these may have been produced before the CSTA standards existed. However, the process of seeing how they fit (or don't fit) with the standards may help give us ideas on how these lessons could be modified.",

This will be done through a series of paired teaching sections, exploring a specific \u201cImpact of Computing\u201d in your typical day and the \u201cTechnologies and Computing Concepts\u201d that enable that impact, all at a K12-appropriate level. \n\nThis course is part of a larger Specialization through which you\u2019ll learn impacts of computing concepts you need to know, organized into 5 distinct digital \u201cworlds\u201d, as well as learn pedagogical techniques and evaluate lesson plans and resources to utilize in your classroom. By the end, you\u2019ll be prepared to teach pre-college learners to be both savvy and effective participants in their digital world.\n\nIn this particular digital world (relationships), you\u2019ll explore the following Impacts &amp; Technology pairs --\n\nImpacts (Keep me connected in a mobile society):, personal relationships, facebook, circle of friends  \nTechnology and Computing Concepts: algorithms, software engineering evolution, heuristics, computer runtime, big O notation, P vs NP\n\nImpacts (Making geography-based connections): findings friends, maps, geolocation\nTechnology and Computing Concepts: data and binary,  image encoding, pixels, how color pickers work, filters, blurs \n\nIn the pedagogy section for this course, in which best practices for teaching computing concepts are explored, you\u2019ll learn about the current CSTA K-12 CS Standards and practice using them to review and apply to lesson plans, as well as how to apply the ICAP framework to connect your students\u2019 engagement to active learning outcomes, such as through peer instruction. \n\nIn terms of CSTA K-12 computer science standards, we\u2019ll primarily cover learning objectives within the \u201cimpacts of computing\u201d concept, while also including some within the \u201cnetworks and the Internet\u201d concepts and the \u201cdata and analysis\u201d concept.  Practices we cover include \u201cfostering and inclusive computing culture\u201d, \u201crecognizing and defining computational problems\u201d, and \u201ccommunicating about computing\u201d.",

Prepara alla professionalit\u00e0 dell'insegnamento e sviluppa competenze teoriche e metodologiche sull'argomento. Le lezioni, in particolare, evidenziano la doppia identit\u00e0 della pedagogia tra scienza e filosofia, sottolineando le diverse direzioni interpretative della ricerca pedagogica attuale. Durante il percorso didattico verranno approfondite le ragioni storiche che, in ambito psicopedagogico, hanno costituito la matrice dalla quale si sono sviluppati i modelli della formazione tradizionali e attuali. Viene introdotto, infine, il concetto di educabilit\u00e0, nel quadro di un approccio bioeducativo alla formazione nella pedagogia contemporanea. Tale concetto viene analizzato, in particolare, nella relazione tra gli apprendimenti espliciti e impliciti. Lo studente viene, quindi, stimolato a conoscere gli elementi caratterizzanti il proprio sistema cognitivo e a saperne fare uso.",

        "overview": "The Hands-on training on Solar Study Lamp Assembly is a part of the Gandhi Global Solar Yatra (GGSY), initiated by Prof. Chetan Singh Solanki, Department of Energy Science and Engineering, IIT Bombay. As a part of this yatra, a Students Solar Ambassador Workshop is organized on the 2nd October 2019, marking the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. Under this workshop, more than 1 Million Students will assemble their own solar study lamps across the globe and will pledge to Non-Violence towards Environment.\n\n\u2018Solar Study Lamp\u2019 is a lighting device consisting of a solar PV module, battery, LED, and electronics. Battery, LED, and electronics are placed in a plastic housing.The look of the lamp is similar to a table lamp wherein the lamp base is connected to the LED via flexible gooseneck. The solar lamp uses 1 Watt LED as the light source and houses 3.2 Volt, 2000 mAh rechargeable Lithium Ferrous Phosphate (LiFePO4) battery to store the power. A 2.5 Watt Solar Panel charges the lamp during daytime. The lamp is designed to provide 5-6 hours of study light every day throughout the year.\n\nThis workshop is expected to be taking place at 10,000-15,000 locations. Till date, 101 countries have registered to be a part of this mega-global event. This course has been designed for Master Trainers. They will be able to understand climate change, energy sustainability and will learn to assemble a solar study lamp. The course also lays protocols for conducting the Students Solar Ambassador Workshop.\n\nA similar workshop was organized last year also, wherein over 1.32 lakh students participated in this mega-global event, of which 5,000 students came to IIT Bombay campus, which was also a Guinness World Record event.\n\nThis course contains 11 modules and 26 sections. The module will contain reading materials, videos, and quizzes, etc. For the successful completion of the course and to receive the due certification, the pursuant should complete the quiz at the end of each module.\n\nIndividuals cannot participate in this workshop any institute can participate and can register on our website <>. If an individual wishes to participate as a Master Trainer, they need to approach the institution and make them register on our website.",

Find out what you\u2019ll be doing and learning.\n\nConditional Loops\n-In this module we will learn about conditional loops and how they vary from fixed loops. We'll examine different examples of both loop types and look at some common challenges that you may come across. Finally you'll create your own conditional loop program and have the opportunity to create an assignment and conduct peer reviews.\n\nMore Conditional Loops\n-Now that you've gotten an introduction to conditional loops, we will further explore them and their variations. We will look at why some programs require conditional loops and discuss suggestions that will help students trace each program. Finally we'll learn about a variation on the repeat until loop, called the do-while loop.\n\nIf statements\n-In this module we'll get an introduction to conditionals, which are also known as if-else statements. First we'll examine some examples of if-else conditionals that exist in our everyday life. Next you will take a look at videos of completed programs and recreate the code. We'll end with some debugging tips and have you create your own if-else program assignment.\n\nMore If statements\n-Now that you have a basic understanding of conditionals, we look at some more complicated cases. You'll watch a video of how a teacher introduces the topic to her class and learn about conditionals with more than 2 scenarios. You'll also look at programs with two independent conditionals and learn how this varies from else-if statements. Finally, you'll analyze some misconceptions and challenges you initially had when learning about conditionals and create resources to help others learn about conditionals.\n\nEquity & Pedagogy\n-In this module we take a look at peer instruction, an interactive teaching method that promotes learning. You will learn how peer instruction works and its benefits through various evidence-based studies. Then you'll determine how it can be applied to a computer science course and examine additional reasons peer instruction is beneficial in teaching computer science in class. You will have the opportunity to apply what you learn when creating a resource and peer reviewing others' work.",

From notions of 'global competency' and 'international branch campuses,' to ever more common perceptions that international collaborative research is a desirable objective, through to the phenomena of bibliometrics, rankings and benchmarking that are framed and operate at a global scale, contexts are changing. This massive open online course (MOOC) itself, developed in Madison and Bristol and hosted on the Coursera platform in Silicon Valley, is a perfect case in point!\nGlobalizing Higher Education and Research for the \u2018Knowledge Economy\u2019 is designed to help students better understand some of these complex changes. Our specific objectives are to:\nProvide an integrated 'big picture' regarding the globalization of higher education and research.  \nReinforce the value of thinking about processes of change by focusing on emergences -- the forward edges of change -- as well as the frictions associated with these processes. We attempt to make this tangible by highlighting the role of relevant logics, thinkers, institutions, networks, technologies, ideas, temporalities, and regulations.\nHighlight the role of relative and variable forms of power in shaping agendas and practices, as well as uneven development patterns and outcomes.",

Where do ideas come from and how do you create them? These are the questions that this course tries to answer.\nThe premise of learning games from some perspectives seems like a perfect and easy solution - get people to learn things they don\u2019t want to by motivating them through game play. To others it seems like an oxymoron - if learning is hard then it can\u2019t possibly be fun at the same time. The key to designing good learning games is to reconcile these perspectives by creating games that focus on creating environments based on \u201chard fun.\u201d This idea will be a central tenet of this course.\nThrough six units comprising nine weeks, we will look at the evolution of educational video games and hear from experts working on many aspects of learning games from design to development to implementation. For the course project, participants will create their own learning game. This course utilizes Gameblox, a game editor that uses a block based programming language to allow anyone to create games.",

We know that the culture of higher education is different from the culture of the military in meaningful ways, and we also know that one of the keys to excelling in college - especially for student veterans - is learning to navigate these differences successfully, right from the very start.\n\nThis course aims to help you do just that. First, the course will orient you to the norms and expectations of the college classroom. The quicker you know what is expected of you, the quicker you can start learning. Second, the course will offer you strategies to ease your transition, to help you achieve your academic goals, and to allow you to make the most of your college education.\n\nWhile this course is open to everyone, the content has been tailored specifically for student veterans currently pursuing higher education, active duty servicemembers who aspire to start school or return to school soon, and higher education professionals who work to support student veterans at their schools. If this sounds like you, and if you\u2019re ready to learn how to make your transition easier and more successful, then we hope you\u2019ll join us.\n\nThis online curriculum may be used in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, as a start-to finish, self-directed online experience (MOOC). It can also, in its current format, serve as an \u201corientation\u201d for other student veteran success programs. We also invite you to utilize this resource as a library/toolkit of academic success strategies, a tool for flipped classroom pedagogy, or a companion text for on-the-ground transition courses.\n\nWe welcome the opportunity to assist higher education institutions (both 2-year and 4-year), military installation education services officers and transition assistance programs, veteran focused non-profit organizations, and more.

Get started solving programming puzzles that use repeats and reflect on what areas students might struggle with. Reinforce your knowledge as you complete a set of programs on google slides -- this time without using Snap to check your work!\n\nMore Repeats\n-More programming with repeats - except with a bit of a challenge! Explore the free curriculum on code.org\u2019s platform analyzing the feedback and hints they provide for their activities. Work closely in their artist environment and examine the difference between code.org block-based programming and your work in Snap.\n\nEquity & Pedagogy\n-Who is learning CS? How is CS being taught?

In this class, you will learn a framework for addressing the social and emotional development and challenging behavior of young children.\nThe overarching goal of this course is to learn evidence-based practices to support the social and emotional development of infants and young children.

Evidence-based classroom management skills will also be studied and you will leave the course with a solid understanding of how to design supportive environments.

Bullying is recognized by the United Nations as a major factor in damaging the overall wellbeing of students, meaning the mental and physical health, causing early school leaving or even suicide. New forms of bullying through social media are adding to the problem, making imperative the need for teachers to find ways of preventing and combating it at school level.\n ",

This focus on constructing and communicating complex ideas is a major shift for many schools who have focused on teaching discrete facts and vocabulary items for multiple choice tests.\nThis course facilitates the practical exploration and expertise-building of seven essential ALD (academic language development) practices that we have identified as being powerful for developing school language and literacy across grade levels and content areas and for supporting the implementation of new standards. The course focuses on three \u201chigh-impact\u201d practices (Using complex texts, Fortifying complex output (written and oral), Fostering academic interactions), which are supported by four essential practices (Clarifying, Modeling, Guiding, and Designing instruction). This course looks closely at the development of \u201clanguage for content and content for language.\u201d It organizes a massive collaboration of educators who wish to support students, particularly English Language Learners, in developing their abilities to use complex language.\nIn order to develop complex language, educators need to be careful observers and analyzers of student language throughout a lesson and when looking at language evidence.This course asks participants to gather, analyze, and share examples of student language from their classrooms. The overall goal is for participating educators to better understand and develop the academic uses of language in school-based learning and apply what they learn in the future.",

We see tinkering as a serious endeavor\u2014one that is generalizable across content and especially good at interweaving disciplines in a way that leads to complex projects and individualized learning opportunities. Tinkering has recently been introduced into the educational field as a potential driver of creativity, excitement, and innovation in science learning. It is seen by many as an effective means to engage in exploring STEM concepts, practices and phenomena. Tinkering typically blends the high and low tech tools of science along with a strong aesthetic dimension that supports children\u2019s (and adults) self expression.\n\nFor over a decade, the Exploratorium has been developing science-rich tinkering activities for both children and adults. We see tinkering as a fun yet serious endeavor\u2014spanning many disciplines and content areas and fostering connections between art, science, and technology. Learners follow their own path to understanding by investigating tools and materials and exploring questions that interest them. This opens up a wide range of possible answers rather than any \u201cright\u201d one, particularly for teaching STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) subjects in the classroom. This course centers on circuit-related activities, which offer a wealth of opportunities for thinking through making.\n\nIn this course, we won\u2019t just show you how we develop tinkering activities; we\u2019ll also delve into why. We\u2019ll focus on three important aspects: activity design around specific materials, facilitation strategies, and environmental organization. We\u2019ll also share some guiding principles and learning indicators we\u2019ve developed that can help you integrate tinkering into your elementary and middle-school science program. Whether you\u2019re new to making or a seasoned tinkerer, we hope this course will help you take the next step!\n\nOUR APPROACH TO TEACHING\n\nThis is a hands-on workshop, not a lecture-based class. Participation is essential! We want everyone to be making and tinkering together: trying things out, asking questions, sharing ideas, and reflecting together as a community. This is a wonderful chance to tinker and learn alongside people from all over the world and from all walks of life, so don\u2019t be shy!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Although this course will not have active instructor participation, we have put a great deal of effort towards creating a supportive space that encourages exploration. We\u2019ll give you a few ways to get started; prompt you to share your own observations and experience as learners, designers and facilitators; and hopefully spark interesting conversations and discoveries along the way. While it\u2019s not a requirement, we encourage you to take this class with a friend or colleague or meet with other people in your area: having support or doing activities with others will enhance your experience and help you stay engaged.\n\nREQUIRED COURSE MATERIALS\n\nYou will need several tools and materials to do weekly course activities. Pre-bundled materials are available from the Exploratorium store at www.artoftinkering.com. Please obtain all materials as soon as possible, well in advance of when you will need them in the course. Be sure to allow extra time for shipping and, if you are outside the U.S., for customs. In some cases, certain items may require assembly.

We'll explore these questions in the readings and forums while getting a sneak preview of the activities we'll be sharing over the following modules.\n\nInitial Explorations\n-Tinkering is all about making, so let's get started. In this module we begin with a basic circuit board activity, which helps learners make physical and conceptual connections between electrical components. You will learn how to build your own set to play with and why we designed it this way.\n\nLearning Dimensions\n-In this module, we'll explore erratic motion and art-making with an activity called Scribbling Machines. We'll also investigate how tinkering maps on to different indicators of learning.\n\nTinkering Tenets and Personal Expression\n-We'll explore the aesthetic dimensions of tinkering with a full rundown of our Paper Circuits and Sewn Circuits activities, including key design elements and important principles.\n\nCoding, Computation and Facilitation Strategies\n-A look at the high-tech side of tinkering. In this module, we'll also explore strategies for facilitation and deep engagement.\n\nPutting It All Together\n-It's your turn! How will you take what you've learned in this class and apply it to your own life and practice? We'll help you come up with a detailed action plan and get feedback from other students in the class. By the end of this module you'll complete your project, your peer assessments and review other people's work.",

Managing intellectual property at Universities can be critical as regulatory authorities push for establishing innovation ecosystems and IP centres. The University Grants Commission (UGC) has asked all universities to set up IP centres. The National Institute Ranking Framework (NIRF) ranks institutions based on the number of patents applied for, granted and commercialised. The National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) awards points to institutes with an innovation ecosystem and a facility for identifying and promoting IP. Both the UGC and All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) recommend changes to the curriculum with a focus on IPR education in technical institutes.\n\nEvery stakeholder in an university, be it the administrators, the professors, the researchers or the students, now need to know the basics of intellectual property and learn how to identify, protect, manage and commercialise them.\n\nThose who take this course should be able to:\na)  Identify the different types of intellectual property generated by universities;\nb) Understand the need for an innovation ecosystem and the benefits it brings to universities;\nc) Know the requirements for setting up an IP centre and get practical training on how IP centres function; and\nd) Learn how startups can be incubated in universities.",

You\u2019ll learn about current EMI practice, and increase your confidence in using English, you\u2019ll also work to grow your intercultural skills.\nJoin us and get prepared for the global classroom.\nThis short course has been created for non-native speakers of English, required to teach in HE through the medium of English. The ideas underpinning the course are based in the work of Professor Jennifer Jenkins and researchers at the Centre for Global Englishes.\nNone",

Practice your programming skills and apply your knowledge of parameters when writing method definitions in Snap programs. Learn some common debugging challenges/tips and create your own abstraction assignment.\n\nAbstractions Part 2\n-Revisit the concept of abstractions with some non-interactive practice problems. Go through some especially tricky problems in a collaborative activity to reinforce the idea that computers do what you tell them to do, not what you hope they do! Finally, we'll learn about the fundamentals of recursion and how block-based graphical environments can make learning recursion visual and easier!\n\nLists Part 1\n-Define lists and discuss uses and representations of lists. Unscramble programs in Snap to better understand the possible operations you can perform with lists. Identify common challenges that students face, create your own assignment, and learn debugging tips.\n\nLists Part 2\n-Revisit the concept of lists with some non-interactive practice problems. Discuss the common mistakes students make while initializing lists and how to better distinguish between index and data. Find an educational video about how lists are used.\n\nEquity & Pedagogy\n-Explore issues of culturally relevant teaching as specific to computer science classrooms -- and some ideas for making our computing classes more culturally relevant. Modify an unplugged activity to be more culturally relevant -- and get some additional ideas from reviewing the work of others!",

Questo corso non \u00e8 concepito per introdurre metodi e concetti che in qualche futuro potranno esservi utili in classe, ma per aiutarvi ad organizzare attivit\u00e0 di coding in classe direttamente durante il MOOC. La maggior parte delle lezioni di questo MOOC sono appuntamenti in diretta streaming che potrete seguire in classe con gli alunni, mettendovi in gioco insieme a loro. Non occorre che abbiate dimestichezza con l\u2019informatica, le attivit\u00e0 proposte sono intuitive e divertenti e nei video far\u00f2 del mio meglio per darvi spunti di riflessione ulteriori. Se non riuscirete ad organizzarvi per seguire le lezioni in diretta potrete sempre riusarle successivamente.\n\nCos\u00ec creeremo su questa piattaforma una comunit\u00e0 di apprendimento fatta di insegnanti, ciascuno con la propria classe. Star\u00e0 a me certificare i vostri progressi, mentre voi certificherete quelli dei vostri alunni. Al termine del MOOC tanto voi quanto i vostri alunni avrete acquisito competenze certificate per le quali alcuni atenei italiani, tra i quali l&#039;Universit\u00e0 di Urbino, riconoscono un credito formativo universitario.\n\nPer le attivit\u00e0 online useremo prevalentemente le risorse di Code.org e Scratch. Per le attivit\u00e0 unplugged (senza computer e senza rete) faremo tutto da soli.\n\nDurante il corso avrete modo di condividere con i colleghi e con me l&#039;impostazione delle attivit\u00e0 nelle vostre classi e creeremo dei gruppi di valutazione tra pari, all&#039;interno dei quali ciascuno di voi giudicher\u00e0 l&#039;impostazione proposta dagli altri.\n\nOra non ci resta che iniziare a fare coding in classe.

Participants will learn SNAP's strategies for analyzing what an assessment is evaluating, analyzing multidimensional student data, and making instructional decisions based on evidence of students' progress and additional needs. Participants will have opportunities throughout the course to practice using these strategies with sample short performance assessments (20 minute tasks) and student data.\nThis course follows a hybrid format designed to support groups of colleagues learning together. Instruction is delivered through four video sessions and the assignments for those sessions are done in these in-person (face-to-face) groups of colleagues. One member of the group should be designated to be a facilitator. Because this format is so unusual, we have created a video (below) to help you with some of the planning decisions that should be made before you begin. Note: SNAP is not present in these meetings -- we provide facilitation guides and all of the materials you will need for the assignments, but these meetings are run by you and your colleagues.\n   ",

During the course, you will learn about the principles of project-based learning and how to start a project in the eTwinning community.\nThroughout the activities, we will look at the entire life cycle of a project, starting with the initial idea, including finding a partner and negotiations to design a common project, and ending with the implementation and evaluation of the project. We will include principles of project work and collaboration, as well as the educational use of various ICT tools that facilitate project work. We will also look at the social aspect of collaborative projects, showing eTwinning not only as a platform in which to implement educational projects, but also as a meeting place between colleagues, an environment where we can share ideas and participate in various professional development activities.\nThis course is based on the content of the Open eTwinning course previously created by the National Support Service in Spain for eTwinning, from the Spanish Ministry of Education. It was partly adapted to incorporate a more European perspective and resources. The team behind the original course supported the redesign of the course for the Teacher Academy.",

        "syllabus": "What is a teacher?\n-The first week of this course looks at what it means to be a teacher. We look at the many roles that a teacher plays and why each of these is important. We consider what it means to be an effective teacher. We look at ways in which we can improve what we do as teachers using a model of continuous professional development. Finally, we consider what a philosophy of education is and how we can develop a philosophy that guides our teaching.\n\nMyself and My Learning\n-The second week of this course looks at teachers\u2019 sense of identity, and the differing reasons and motivations people have for becoming a teacher. We ask you to consider the influences on you and particularly the people who may have played a part in your decision to join the profession. You will reflect on the nature of transactions in the classroom and the differing ways in which students respond to how teachers address them. The fourth lecture draws on educational theorist Jacob Kounin\u2019s key strategies that expert teachers to manage classrooms effectively.\n\nInfluences on my learning\n-The third week of this course continues the theme of how your teaching and learning has been influenced by other key people or events. You will learn about the primary motivations that persuade people to take up teaching as a career. How do you communicate with children, or adult learners, in ways that helps them to grasp key concepts and ways of thinking? Reflecting on your teaching and on your students\u2019 learning may help you to have a greater impact as a teacher. The fourth lecture, entitled Asking or Telling address fundamental issues of pedagogy, reminding us that \u2018telling\u2019 is rarely an effective strategy for teaching either as a teacher or a parent, whereas questioning requires activity and involvement on the part of the learner.\n\nImpacts on my learning\n-This week we look at the impact our social identities have on our learning. The four lectures in week four are all related to the theme of difference. It will be important for you to think about your own socialization and how you learned about difference. Is difference something you learned to value or is it something you have learned to ridicule? Think about how you deal with difference in your personal context and in your classroom. We encourage you to write a narrative in which you bring together a reflection on your own socialization and how this impacts on your teaching.\n\nHow do I learn?\n-How do I learn best? During this week we will focus on how you learn best and how you can make the connections with your own classroom and learners. We encourage you to think more about how we learn as teachers, and how we can create the best conditions for ourselves and our students to learn.\n\nMy learning environment\n-Congratulations, you have stayed throughout the course 'Being a teacher'. I hope you have been making the connection between how you have learned and how you teach. During this week we will focus on 'My learning environment'. We will explore the principles of pedagogy, specifically Alexander\u2019s nine aspects of pedagogy. In the fourth and final lecture, we also revisit some of the key ideas explored on the course.",

Think about how many parents purchase their children smartphones, gaming systems, iPads, or other digital devices. With access to the internet, these devices allow children to connect to other in ways we never could have imagined.\nWith the proliferation of devices comes concerns regarding cyberbullying, screentime, digital citizenship, media literacy and exposure to inappropriate content. For parents, keeping up with their children's use of technology can be a daunting challenge.\nThe question then becomes, what can parents do to help kids use these devices responsibility? When online, how can parents make sure their children are safe? What can parents do prevent the sharing of personally identifiable information?\nThis course provides an introduction to strategies for successfully parenting in the digital age.\nKey topics include discovery of what kids are doing online, social media and gaming, tips for helping kids stay safe online, protecting privacy, security and building a positive digital footprint.\nThe course includes a series of videos, websites, interactive activities, discussions and quizzes.

El modelo de la sociedad industrial est\u00e1 dejando paso a un nuevo modelo de sociedad, a\u00fan difuso, en el que la capacidad de transformar la informaci\u00f3n en conocimiento es clave. Es f\u00e1cil deducir que para esta nueva sociedad emergente se necesita un concepto de educaci\u00f3n bien distinto al que requer\u00eda la sociedad industrial. Sin este cambio educativo dif\u00edcilmente se podr\u00e1 conseguir satisfactoriamente el cambio y, consecuentemente, instalarse adecuadamente en un mundo que va a alterarse radicalmente.\nEl curso tiene dos objetivos. El primero es presentar el fen\u00f3meno de la transformaci\u00f3n de la sociedad que estamos viviendo y los fundamentos para definir el mundo que est\u00e1 emergiendo como el de la sociedad del conocimiento. La pretensi\u00f3n de la primera parte es disponer de un escenario suficientemente detallado y s\u00f3lido de lo que est\u00e1 sucediendo y superar as\u00ed la visi\u00f3n e interpretaci\u00f3n triviales que pueda haber sobre un nuevo modelo de sociedad. Sin esta buena base es dif\u00edcil fundamentar el siguiente objetivo del curso: el papel de la educaci\u00f3n.\nEl objetivo de tratar la educaci\u00f3n en este curso es para presentarla en estrecha relaci\u00f3n con una intensa crisis cultural que inevitablemente tiene que sobrevenir para que no aumente el desajuste entre el mundo tecnol\u00f3gico -planetario, desigual y contradictorio- que hemos levantado y los valores culturales de otros tiempos con los que queremos mirar e interpretar el mundo de hoy y el que se avecina. As\u00ed que se tratar\u00e1 la estrecha relaci\u00f3n que hay y debe haber entre educaci\u00f3n y cultura. De igual modo se ver\u00e1 en el curso la relaci\u00f3n entre tecnolog\u00eda y educaci\u00f3n, no desde el punto de vista instrumental, sino cultural.",

The orientation will also help you obtain the technical skills required for the course.\n\nMODULE 1: Learning, Design, and Technology\n-In this module, we will identify and discuss the field of learning technologies. We will also discuss the landscape of careers and potential career paths related to learning technologies across organizations.\n\nModule 2: The Evolvement of Learning Technologies\n-In this module, students will gain an understanding on the evolution of learning technologies and technology\u2019s impact on the emerging global citizenship as it relates to teaching and learning situated in broad and diverse contexts. In addition, students will revisit major concepts of learning theories discussed in HRD 411 MOOC.\n\nMODULE 3: Designing Technology-Enriched and -Enabled Learning Environments (TEELE)\n-In this module, students will develop understanding on the complexity of designing and developing effective learning technologies for teaching and learning purposes across contexts. Specifically, students will learn about E3, Motivation, Volition, and Performance (MVP), and transactional distance design frameworks for designing effective, technology-enriched and enabled learning environments (TEELE). Furthermore, students will develop foundational understanding on diversity issues related to learning technologies. In particular, this week will introduce students to assistive technologies and needs of senior citizens in the context of learning technologies.\n\nMODULE 4: Cognitive Load Theory and Implications on E-Learning and TEELE\n-In this module, students will develop foundational understanding on Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), which guides the design and development of TEELE and learning technologies based on empirical findings. CLT is most applicable for explaining how the design of TEELE could help learners optimize their limited cognitive capacity (i.e., working memory) for efficient learning processes.\n\nCOURSE CONCLUSION",

Credit for taking this course is conferred only on those that enroll in the degree. The text in the following sections comes from the syllabus for CS6460, located here.\nThis class is simultaneously an introductory course about educational technology and an advanced, project-oriented class on designing or researching technology's intersection with education. As such, the course provides information about a large number of topics within educational technology, including pedagogical strategies, research methodologies, current tools, open problems, and broader issues. The scope of the material provided goes beyond what any one person could reasonably learn in a semester. Instead, you will select those areas that appeal to you or that support your ultimate project ideas. For example, if you're interested in research, you may focus on the applicable research methodologies to your chosen area of investigation, relevant pedagogical strategies or theories, and the current state-of-the-art within that community. If you're interested in design, you may focus on the relevant pedagogical strategies or theories for your chosen domain, the current popular tools within that domain, and open problems that need to be addressed.",

Instead, by the end of this class, you will have sufficient knowledge to contribute to the field in some way, though not every way. This means the learning goal of the class is determined in part by your own goals in taking this class:\nAre you interested in understanding how technology can help education more theoretically? Then your learning goals would include knowledge of research methodologies, promising pedagogical strategies, and current theories in the community.\nAre you interested in designing technologies that can help learners learn better? Then your learning goals would include knowledge of pedagogical strategies, current state-of-the-art tools, and the open problems in education and technology.\nAre you interested in evaluating existing technologies? Then your learning goals would include knowledge of research methodologies in user testing, current state-of-the-art tools, and broader issues surrounding the impact of such tools.\nAre you interested in contributing to the education enterprise more broadly, even if it isn't at the point of learning? Then your learning goals would include knowledge of the current problems in the field, broader issues surrounding the use of tools in supporting education, and the present tools that address those problems.",

This module will help you to recognize historical narratives and present day consequences on campus, from the way students are admitted to the buildings on campus.\n\nBias of Consciousness\n-Higher education institutions have been shaped through a history of exclusion. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Women's Colleges, and Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) are a few examples of these institutions. This module will help you to understand the various structures, schools, and organizations that have developed as a result of historical exclusion and the role each plays in equity, diversity, and inclusion on campuses across the United States.\n\nContested Discourse\n-Social discourse is intertwined with modern issues faced by students on campus. Student movements develop in response to contested discourse and seek to change not only tensions on campus, but address social inequities as well. This module will provide background on contested discourse as well as highlight several student movements addressing contemporary campus issues.\n\nStrategic Diversity Planning\n\nRethinking Leaders, Leadership and Leadership Development",

In this course you will have the support of a community and harness the power of collaboratively exchanging ideas with colleagues, as you design a teaching task (writing prompt) aligned with the Common Core.\n \nYou will use a template from the Literacy Design Collaborative (LDC) to design a task that incorporates literacy into your content area and then create a brief plan for its use. These template tasks are a part of a much more in-depth LDC Module design and will serve to introduce you to the model and process.  ",

This will give you important facts about this module and what it is designed to assess. Following this, we\u2019ll show you the differences between each section of the IELTS Listening Test and the types of questions you will need to answer. You will also have opportunities to practise these types of questions and gain the skills that you need.\n\nMODULE 2: SPEAKING\nThis module outlines the different features of the Speaking Test. In preparation for Part 1 of the Speaking Test, we focus on some of the grammar that you can use to talk about your likes and dislikes. We\u2019ll also give you some examples of how to extend your answers, or make them longer. For Part 2 of the test, we\u2019ll then focus on the \u201cIndividual Long Turn\u201d. We\u2019ll look at how to analyse the task effectively and how to organise your ideas so that you have a good start, and end, to your talk. For Part 3 of the test, we will focus on \u201cThe Discussion\u201d. You\u2019ll learn to develop vocabulary related to common Part 3 topics and also some of the common grammar features you need for success in the discussion. This includes focussing on tenses and making comparisons. Later in the unit, we\u2019ll introduce some strategies to make your pronunciation clearer. In this module, you can watch and learn from videos of students taking different parts of the test. \n\n\nThis module begins with an overview of the IELTS Reading Test and what it includes. This will give you important information about what the test is designed to assess and the different question types used in the test. There will be opportunities to practise the skills you have learned.\n\n\nThe module begins with an overview of the IELTS Writing Test and what it includes. We\u2019ll then look at the two tasks involved in the test. In preparation for Task 1, you\u2019ll learn how to identify different types of visuals, identify and describe the topic and the main features of these visuals, and also how to write an overview paragraph to summarise the key information. We\u2019ll then look at describing data for Task 1 of the test. You\u2019ll learn about what language to use to describe data, as well as how to select and group information. We\u2019ll also look at the language used for ordering ideas in paragraphs. In addition, this module offers the chance to practise writing the opening and data description paragraphs, which you can grade with our new assessment criteria. Additionally, you can get feedback on your writing from your peers and give them feedback using the IELTSx criteria. In preparation for Task 2, we\u2019re going to take a closer look at the essay question to help you answer all its parts and we will examine ways of planning and organising your essay. We\u2019ll also analyse the different parts of an IELTS essay, look in more detail at some possible task types in Task 2, and explain how they are assessed. We\u2019ll then look at how to write a good essay with good structure and appropriate language. Along the way, you\u2019ll have a chance to practise writing an introduction, body paragraphs and conclusion and submit these for assessment from other IELTSx students. There will also be practice of proofreading and editing.",

        "overview": "Interested in earning a certificate at no cost? Enroll to audit this course, and we\u2019ll send more information about this opportunity shortly before the course begins. \n\nCommunities have always wrestled with the multiple purposes of education: to train young people for careers, vocations, and college; to prepare them for their roles as citizens; to develop habits of reflective, ethical adults; and to create a common experience in a pluralistic society while meeting the needs of individual learners. As the world changes and grows more complex, returning to these important questions of purpose can help guide schools in their growth and strategic change. To ensure our schools are effective, we need to routinely reimagine what the high school graduate of the future will need to know and be able to do. The artifact that communicates these ideas is called a graduate profile. Making explicit the capabilities, competencies, knowledge, and attitudes for secondary school graduates, and inviting key stakeholders like students and community members to be engaged in the process, can help you and your school to focus your vision of success and drive school innovation efforts.\n\nInstructor Justin Reich and the course team from the MIT Teaching Systems Lab look forward to guiding teachers, administrators, community members, and others passionate about improving secondary school in the process of designing a graduate profile. Over four weeks, you will reflect on the purpose and goals of secondary school, as well as desirable characteristics for graduates. You\u2019ll learn how schools have benefited from a graduate profile development process and begin the process yourself.  You\u2019ll learn more about your own context, its values and beliefs. You\u2019ll leave the course with a shareable artifact that communicates a vision of a multi-faceted secondary school graduate.\n\nThis course has been authored by one or more members of the Faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

CPL is not awarded for EXPERIENCE but for college-level LEARNING after a significant assessment of the knowledge, skills and competencies students have obtained as result of their prior learning experience. This course will explore CPL theories, service delivery models, policy development steps, college and industry articulation development, portfolio development and assessment, and existing credit crosswalks and available assessment resources. A three track design, for College Faculty and Staff, Workforce Center and Community Based Organization Partners, and members of Industry will focus topics relevant to the work you are doing to help adults earn credits for what they have learned and to apply those credits to a degree or certificate that enhances their opportunities for college completion and gainful employment.",

Incontreremo amici autorevoli che ci daranno consigli preziosi, ma soprattutto ci faremo aiutare dai vostri alunni.\nIl metodo \u00e8 quello di CodeMOOC: io mi rivolgo a te perch\u00e9 sia tu a rivolgerti ai tuoi alunni nei modi e nei tempi che ritieni pi\u00f9 opportuni per fare in classe cose che potranno o no assomigliare a quelle che faremo insieme.",

By taking research as a model, school culture reconnects with the rigor of the scientific approach, the development of critical thinking, the desire to explore the unknown and to innovate while inspiring creativity and collaboration.\nTeachers thus engage their students in cooperative, rigorous projects where they utilize numerous skills such as: observing, asking questions, describing, formulating hypotheses, accumulating knowledge, experimenting, modeling, exchanging information, presenting their arguments, and validating results. Asking questions, making mistakes, testing, iteration, comparing the model with reality, teamwork, and opening up the school to the outside world are just some of the drivers of students' learning.",

Indeed students with vision impairments may need instruction in a variety of specific skills - identified as the expanded core curriculum. The curriculum should be balanced with due consideration given to the children's intellectual, personal, emotional and social developments. To teach visually impaired children, the teacher should adopt a consistent, realistic and flexible approach in curriculum planning and implementation.

        "syllabus": "Mindsets for Learning and Teaching\n-This is our first week together and we are pleased you have decided to participate in this course focused on planning for teaching and learning. This week we will discuss developing a growth mindset and setting goals as a planning professional. We will also explore the importance of working from a model of learning when planning for teaching. We encourage you to be curious in your approach to planning for teaching and learning.\n\nWhat Do We Know About Teaching and Learning\n-In this week you will think about your planning from three perspectives: considering, reflecting, and understanding. You will use these three perspectives to better understand how you can use learning principles to incorporate different worldviews into your teaching. We are going to ask you to think about how you could weave together practices from these three perspectives in your own setting.\n\nFour Key Questions and Why They Matter\n-In this week we introduce four key questions. The questions are diagnostic tools that can tell you how successful you are at giving your students clear expectations and providing them with good feedback. In this week\u2019s lectures, readings and videos you will be provided with examples of how a range of schools are using these questions to focus their learning. We encourage you and your professional planning partner to design you own ways of using these questions in your school or setting.\n\nSpirals of Inquiry for Planning and Teaching\n-Week four follows the pattern we have set in the first three weeks. This week we explore how you can inform and deepen your planning for teaching and learning by engaging in a specific inquiry cycle. All of the lectures this week focus on the various phases or stages of the spiral of inquiry. The spiral of inquiry asks us to start with the experiences of our learners and to continually ask ourselves these questions: What\u2019s going on for our learners? How do we know? Why does it matter?\n\nTeacher Professional Learning\n-As teachers, we usually think about planning from the perspective of how we can better teach our students. This week we are going to focus on planning for the learning needs of the adults in our schools. One of the most important findings from the research on teacher professional learning is that it must be tied to the learning needs of the students. We are going to provide you with some practical examples of what this might look like. By the end of this week you will know how to apply current research knowledge to your own professional learning and planning. We hope that you will continue to reflect on new forms of ongoing professional learning as part of your teaching life.\n\nInnovation and Change\n-This is the final week of this course and we appreciate your perseverance! This week you are going to have the opportunity to think about designing more innovative learning environments for young people. You will see how teachers are planning intellectually and socially engaging practices for learners. You will also extend your thinking about the growth mindset by exploring the notions of perseverance and grit, a quality that is highly correlated with adult success. As well, you are going to think about the important role that both trusting relationships and professional networks play in your development as a teacher. We encourage you to think about the ways in which you are contributing to strengthening relational trust in your settings.",

Information comes at us faster than ever before, and our ability to solve problems depends on us being able to make sense of and synthesize this information. We must also design new solutions using all available technology and tools.\nDigital-age problem solving combines three key skills and concepts essential to understanding and solving problems in the information age: data literacy, design thinking, and computational thinking. Data literacy is the ability to analyze, interpret, and tell stories using complex sets of data. Design thinking is the ability to understand problems and develop creative solutions. Computational thinking is the process of expressing solutions so that humans and computers can understand them.\nThroughout this MOOC-Ed, you'll have the opportunity to dig into digital-age problem solving, engage with its component skills and concepts, and learn how to integrate them into your instructional practice. This course will not be heavy on coding, and you won't need to know any code going in - it will focus on how to integrate digital-age problem solving in a practical way into your classroom.\nCourse Objectives",

This course is designed to prepare online instructors who teach college and university courses to be able to increase instructor, social, and cognitive presence in their online courses. Each of the weekly modules contains annotated research related to the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework, grounding the application-based activities in theory. Engagement in this networked community of practice is designed to stimulate the process of inquiry and collaboration among educators. Participants will explore emerging technologies and create digital assets that they can employ in their own instruction.\nIn an effort to ensure that the course would be pedagogically beneficial for faculty who teach online, the pedagogical competencies for online teaching success defined by Penn State were reviewed. The Humanizing Online Instruction MOOC addresses nine of the 27 competencies. The competencies that are aligned with this course include (1) attend to the unique challenges of distance learning where learners are separated by time and geographic proximity and interactions are primarily asynchronous in nature, (2) provide detailed feedback on assignments and exams, (3) communicate with students about course progress and changes, (4) promote and encourage a learning environment that is safe and inviting and mutually respectful, (5) monitor and manage student progress, (6) communicate course goals and outcomes, (7) provide evidence to students of their presence in the course on a regular basis, (8) effectively use course communication systems, and (9) communicate expectations of student course behavior (Ragan, Bigatel, Kennan, & Dillon, 2012). The course objectives were carefully crafted to align with these competencies.",

MOOCs initiatives have mushroomed in diverse areas, including the creation of learning content; the development of purpose-built platforms and aggregators; the definition of quality assessment systems; advanced tools and services provision; knowledge delivery and educational publishing.\nThe MOOCs explosion has also opened the way to debate \u2013 at times heated \u2013 regarding traditional Higher education business models, the importance of educational technology in self-learning, the role and status of teachers, and issues regarding assessment and accreditation where more personalised courses are concerned.\nThe MOOC landscape is fast changing. As the MOOC market continues to grow, and new players continue to enter, do Universities still hold a dominant role? How is their strategy evolving? The original MOOC academic format seems to be under pressure from various sides to better adapt to the web environment. But also to respond to a more professional \u2013 and less scholarly \u2013 target.\nThe changing boundaries of the MOOC identity is the main theme of the Anacapri 2016 International Colloquium.",

It is a key competence that can be developed through any school subject, from primary to secondary and beyond. It does not necessarily involve a specific school subject. Rather, it requires a way of teaching in which experiential learning and project work have the main role. This MOOC has been designed with the intention to provide concrete examples for the practical implementation of the Entrepreneurship Competence Framework (EntreComp). Each module consists of several videos, illustrating lesson plans, teaching activities, or possible resources that could enable teachers, and educators to strengthen entrepreneurial skills in their students.

It is a key competence that can be developed through any school subject, from primary to secondary and beyond. It does not necessarily involve a specific school subject. Rather, it requires a way of teaching in which experiential learning and project work have the main role.\n\nThis MOOC has been designed with the intention to provide concrete examples for the practical implementation of the Entrepreneurship Competence Framework (EntreComp). Each module consists of several videos, illustrating lesson plans, teaching activities, or possible resources that could enable teachers, and educators to strengthen entrepreneurial skills in their students.\n\nWe challenge you to use these resources in your classrooms and nurture your students\u2019 desire to solve problems creatively and to take on opportunities in any social context.",

        "syllabus": "Welcome to U101!\n-Welcome to University 101. This short course will help you get the most out of your college experience. We want to help incoming undergraduates understand their universities. This opening module lays out what the course is and how you will navigate this online space.\n\nUnderstanding the Nature of College\n-Now that we have discussed the basic approach in this course, we can dive into the material. A good place to start would be understanding how the university operates. Modern universities are large, complex organizations employing thousands of different teaching and researching faculty, all of who have slightly different roles. College isn\u2019t simply larger than high school, it is structured differently.\n\nSucceeding as a Student\n-You\u2019re coming to college to get an education. Classes will take up a significant amount of your time, so we should discuss some strategies for success. As discussed in the last module, high school differs significantly from college. Incoming freshmen are often most worried about the classes. You have much more flexible time, but that time needs to be filled with self-directed study. In this unit, we\u2019ll talk a bit about how understanding these classes and studying effectively for them.\n\nBuilding Your Education\n-One of your big questions at college is, \u201cWhat should I major in?\u201d This module will tackle this question head on. In all honesty, what you major in matters less than how you prepare yourself to be an expert in an area. This requires you to move beyond simply your major and take ownership of your intellectual and professional development during your college years.\n\nFinancing Your Education\n-Paying for college is a challenge. This module will talk about some strategies for budgeting your money while at college and all the options available to you for funding. There are so many different resources out there to help you pay for college. Regrettably, these are so broad that students remain unaware of them. This module should direct you to some of the most fruitful areas for finding funding.\n\nLiving On and Off Campus\n-Are you going to live on-campus or off? There are strengths and benefits to doing both. This module will talk to some students about their experiences living on and off campus. Wherever you live while at college, odds are that you will experience homesickness at some point. This is entirely natural. We\u2019ll talk a bit about why this happens and identify a few strategies for effectively dealing with homesickness.\n\nGetting Involved in Campus Life\n-Going to your classes is probably the most important thing you\u2019ll do during your time here. But it won\u2019t be the only thing. Campus clubs and groups offer you a great opportunity to experience new things and ideas during your time here. They can introduce you to lifelong friends and enrich your education in untold ways. This module will talk about some options for getting involved in campus life.\n\nConclusion\n-Here we are at the end of this online orientation. Thank you for participating. This module will recap the key themes from the course and help you figure out what to do next as you prepare to enroll in college. Good Luck!",

        "overview": "E-learning and Digital Cultures is aimed at teachers, learning technologists, and people with a general interest in education who want to deepen their understanding of what it means to teach and learn in the digital age. The course is about how digital cultures intersect with learning cultures online, and how our ideas about online education are shaped through \u201cnarratives\u201d, or big stories, about the relationship between people and technology. We\u2019ll explore some of the most engaging perspectives on digital culture in its popular and academic forms, and we\u2019ll consider how our practices as teachers and learners are informed by the difference of the digital. We\u2019ll look at how learning and literacy is represented in popular digital-, (or cyber-) culture, and explore how that connects with the visions and initiatives we are seeing unfold in our approaches to digital education.\nThis course will not be taught via a series of video lectures. Rather, a selection of rich resources will be provided through which you can begin to engage with the themes of the course. While the teachers will be present in the discussion forums and in various other media environments, there will be an emphasis on learner-led group formation, and the use of social media to build personal learning networks and communities of peers. On this course, you will be invited to think critically and creatively about e-learning both as a process and as a topic of study; you will be able to try out new ideas in a supportive environment, and gain fresh perspectives on your own experiences of teaching and learning.  This course is also intended to be an exploration  of the MOOC format itself.  Rather than approaching this course with the expectation of exacting teaching methods or precise learning routines, we invite all participants to collectively experiment with what the MOOC experience might be.",

        "overview": "Many times in students\u2019 lives assessment is synonym of stressful experience, and connecting \u201clearning\u201d with \u201cstress\u201d means making it an awful experience after all, which compromises long term memory of what you have learned. Neuroscientific research proved it already; positive motivation, on the contrary, promote a qualitative improvement of the brain circuitry involved in memory and executive functions.\nSuperior learning happens in classroom experiences relevant to students\u2019 lives, interests and experiences. So: what if we moved the assessment within the learning path? We could transform it in a check-in to see if learning is there, otherwise we could give feedback and support students to get back on track. A question or an exercise, every once in a while, does not interrupt the learning flux but supports it in keeping the right direction, toward the achievement of the learning outcomes. After that learning will be already there, it\u2019s only a matter of its measurement.\nThis MOOC is entitled \u201cNew Assessment Strategies\u201d, because it focuses on new ways to perform assessment, focusing on learning and not only on its measurement. It is part of the \u201cMOOCs for Teachers\u201d series and according to the series\u2019 style, it talks mainly to teachers who want to improve their effective support to students. It could be interesting also for teachers and professors who already apply formative assessment strategies with their students and surround their class time and online activities with the magic of feedback, but are still willing to see new perspectives and are seeking for people to share their experience with. Any other participant, as usual, is more than welcome to share their non-professional, role-free, in-depth opinion on the subject: their contribution can only enrich our participants further on!",

It is not only about helping that kid identifying the interest but progress through that interest, become more advanced\u201d, Diana Rhoten, Director, Digital Media and Learning Program, Social Science Research Council.\nStudents are learning not only at school, but also in a variety of so-called non-formal and informal learning settings outside of school. Such individual learning interests could for instance include for a young person to learn a new skill like playing a guitar through youtube videos. Learning takes place when something is happening that captures the young person\u2019s interest. \u201cIt is something that can influence you, something that brings out emotions and allows yourself to find answers to certain questions.\u201d\nIn this course, you will learn:\nwhat formal, non-formal and informal learning is\nhow to empower your students to learn in these different settings also by creating more synergies\nhow to use personalizing and collaborative learning as teaching approaches to empower your students in their own learning",

        "overview": "Teachers in the classroom today have to be equipped with a variety of tools.  Not only do they need to have subject knowledge and the ability to effectively teach, they must also have excellent classroom management skills.  When challenging behavior in the classroom becomes a barrier to instruction, teachers who understand the fundamental principles behind functional behavior assessment (FBA) are prepared to address the behavior before it becomes so disruptive additional resources outside the classroom are needed.   Have you ever had a student who is constantly talking out, getting out of his seat, and disturbing his classmates while you are trying to teach?  No matter how many times you say something to him the behavior persists or gets worse?    You continually ask yourself\u2026 Why does David do that? In this course you will learn how to determine \u201cWhy?\u201d a student engages in challenging behavior and develop interventions that promote positive behaviors, replacing challenging behavior.\nWhether teaching in a general education or special education setting, the key to effective behavior intervention is the functional behavior assessment.   There are various forms of the functional behavior assessment.  We will focus on how teachers can use the direct method of functional behavior assessment as part of their classroom routine.  In this course you will learn how to conduct an FBA.  You will learn how to analyze the FBA to determine the antecedents that set the stage for challenging behavior, and determine the function of the behavior. You will also be able to use what you learn about principles of reinforcement,  to create a function based intervention addressing the antecedents, consequences and promoting replacement behaviors.   What you learn in this course will help you intervene with challenging behaviors in your classroom before they escalate into behaviors that require involvement of additional school faculty and staff beyond your classroom.

When implemented correctly, such practices have been proven to increase students\u2019 achievement in a wide range of content areas at all grade levels. Cooperative learning models will be explored to understand the variables that differentiate group work from true cooperative learning, including individual accountability and group rewards. The effectiveness of student teams to support learning through peer motivation, peer assessment and reteaching will be examined in depth.\nCourse Objectives\nDefine the concept of cooperative learning and how it relates to today\u2019s learner.\nDescribe how cooperative learning works when there is individual accountability, equal opportunities for success and team recognition built into a task.\nDescribe the four theoretical perspectives of cooperative learning.\nConsider the impact of cooperative learning on 21st century skills and meeting the cognitive demands of the Common Core State Standards.",

According to several studies, play and creativity have been linked in numerous ways, as play has been found to facilitate insight ability and divergent thinking.\nActually, play has long been an essential tool for learning. For some time now, a number of educators around the world have come to realize that games are problem-solving activities approached with a playful attitude. That\u2019s why they engage and excite students, resulting, consequently, in deeper learning and development of various skills when used for educational purposes. However, along with its influence in all areas of society, technology has brought many changes in the playtime as well. Kids nowadays, for instance, can create their own games instead of going to the closest store to buy one, or they can immerse themselves in virtual or augmented reality experiences to play.\nThe Learning with creativity: Let the game begin! course aims to encourage primary and secondary teachers from all subject disciplines to reflect about the importance of learning through play and to show them ways to introduce games in the classroom. This MOOC is especially valuable for teachers who want to promote learning with games, creating through games and , and it will serve to provide participants with various tools, resources and practices for a more efficient and innovative teaching and learning.",

We see tinkering as a serious endeavor\u2014one that is generalizable across content and especially good at interweaving disciplines in a way that leads to complex projects and individualized learning opportunities. Tinkering has recently been introduced into the educational field as a potential driver of creativity, excitement, and innovation in science learning. It is seen by many as an effective means to engage in exploring STEM concepts, practices and phenomena. Tinkering typically blends the high and low tech tools of science along with a strong aesthetic dimension that supports children\u2019s (and adults) self expression.\n\nFor over a decade, the Exploratorium has been developing science-rich tinkering activities for both children and adults. We see tinkering as a fun yet serious endeavor\u2014spanning many disciplines and content areas and fostering connections between art, science, and technology. Learners follow their own path to understanding by investigating tools and materials and exploring questions that interest them. This opens up a wide range of possible answers rather than any \u201cright\u201d one, particularly for teaching STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) subjects in the classroom. This course centers on circuit-related activities, which offer a wealth of opportunities for thinking through making.\n\nIn this course, we won\u2019t just show you how we develop tinkering activities; we\u2019ll also delve into why. We\u2019ll focus on three important aspects: activity design around specific materials, facilitation strategies, and environmental organization. We\u2019ll also share some guiding principles and learning indicators we\u2019ve developed that can help you integrate tinkering into your elementary and middle-school science program. Whether you\u2019re new to making or a seasoned tinkerer, we hope this course will help you take the next step!\n\nOUR APPROACH TO TEACHING\n\nThis is a hands-on workshop, not a lecture-based class. Participation is essential! We want everyone to be making and tinkering together: trying things out, asking questions, sharing ideas, and reflecting together as a community. This is a wonderful chance to tinker and learn alongside people from all over the world and from all walks of life, so don\u2019t be shy!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Although this course will not have active instructor participation, we have put a great deal of effort towards creating a supportive space that encourages exploration. We\u2019ll give you a few ways to get started; prompt you to share your own observations and experience as learners, designers and facilitators; and hopefully spark interesting conversations and discoveries along the way. While it\u2019s not a requirement, we encourage you to take this class with a friend or colleague or meet with other people in your area: having support or doing activities with others will enhance your experience and help you stay engaged.\n\nREQUIRED COURSE MATERIALS\n\nYou will need several tools and materials to do weekly course activities. Pre-bundled materials are available from the Exploratorium store at www.artoftinkering.com. Please obtain all materials as soon as possible, well in advance of when you will need them in the course.

We'll explore these questions in the readings and forums while getting a sneak preview of the activities we'll be sharing over the following modules.\n\nInitial Explorations\nTinkering is all about making, so let's get started. In this module we begin with a basic circuit board activity, which helps learners make physical and conceptual connections between electrical components. You will learn how to build your own set to play with and why we designed it this way.\n\nLearning Dimensions\nIn this module, we'll explore erratic motion and art-making with an activity called Scribbling Machines. We'll also investigate how tinkering maps on to different indicators of learning.\n\nTinkering Tenets and Personal Expression\nWe'll explore the aesthetic dimensions of tinkering with a full rundown of our Paper Circuits and Sewn Circuits activities, including key design elements and important principles.\n\n\nA look at the high-tech side of tinkering. In this module, we'll also explore strategies for facilitation and deep engagement.\n\n\nIt's your turn! How will you take what you've learned in this class and apply it to your own life and practice? We'll help you come up with a detailed action plan and get feedback from other students in the class. By the end of this module you'll complete your project, your peer assessments and review other people's work.",

In fact, research evidence suggests that people can become effective teachers if they learn:\nthe content of their discipline\nthe different ways students learn this content and the problems they face with it\nhow to manage learning in practice in a classroom.\n\nThis MOOC focuses on the second and third of these elements.\n\nThe ways in which students learn in science and engineering programs, and the problems they typically face, have been the subject of a great deal of research in the last two decades.  This MOOC is based on that research evidence and is designed to clarify the ways in which teaching assistants can help students to maximise their learning in university-level programmes.\n\nTeaching is a hands-on activity and to learn how to teach you will need practical experience.  Alongside such practical experience, this MOOC will be able to help you understand what strategies are likely to be appropriate and why, and will also give you some guidance on when and where to use them.  While classroom experience will undoubtedly be valuable, this MOOC can give you the knowledge to be able to plan and evaluate your own teaching and to make good decisions in the classroom. \n\nIn this MOOC we have tried to practice what we preach.  You will find, therefore, that in addition to watching videos you will be encouraged to take notes, to sometimes stop the video and complete thinking tasks, and to test your own recall and understanding of the material using quiz questions.  We would encourage you to use these opportunities to learn but also to reflect upon them and to ask yourself if you could do something similar in your own teaching. \n\nThe MOOC is designed to be self-paced - there are no set deadlines and you can complete the whole MOOC in a time frame that suits you.",

It takes a historical perspective in order to define the contemporary dimensions of what we term \u201cnew learning.\u201d It prepares participants to make purposeful choices and link particular theories/instructional approaches to individual and group learning goals.\n\nModule 2: What is New Learning?\n-This module explores some of the key terms of education: formal versus informal learning; and the distinctions that might be made between the terms \"education,\" \"curriculum,\" and \"pedagogy.\" It also addresses the question of the differences between education as an art and a science.\n\nModule 3: Didactic and Authentic education\n-In this module, course participants analyze two foundational paradigms of modern education, which we term \"didactic\" and \"authentic\" approaches.\n\nModule 4: Transformative Education - New Learning\n-In the final module of this course, we will be considering prospects for the future of education, imaging a \"new learning\" based on a repertoire of moves drawn from the didactic and authentic pedagogies. What does transformative education mean, in theory as well as in practice?",

        "syllabus": "Mindfulness in teaching\n-Since stress and anxiety accompany many teachers\u2019 work settings and arise from a variety of sources, we look for ways to reduce that stress. Mindfulness programs provide one source of relief for work related stress and, for some, an avenue for self and other exploration. Here we describe some aspects of those programs and encourage those so inclined to seek out such experiences.\n\nCenter for Courage and Renewal programs for teacher and community well-being\n-The Center for Courage and Renewal\u2019s programs for teachers encourage reflection on the social and emotional dimensions of teaching. In this module we focus on Center\u2019s \u201cLeading Together\u201d program, one that encourages trust and communication within a school\u2019s adult community.\n\nThe role of narrative in teachers' social and emotional learning\n-Echoing Mark Edmundson (Why Read?) and other writers on the prominent role of the humanities in a liberal arts education, we argue for and elaborate the role of narrative and the humanities in teacher education and teacher professional development. In this module we show how narrative -- film, fiction, and other similar \u201ctexts\u201d-- can be used to explore more fully one\u2019s humanity in teaching, offer insights into the role of teacher, and come to a richer and fuller understanding of one\u2019s students.\n\nParents, families, and communities: Social and emotional learning in context\n-This module examines the importance of understanding that students\u2019 rich offstage lives affect at every turn their lives within the classroom and school. A set of readings explores the \u201cghosts\u201d in parents\u2019 and teachers\u2019 pasts and how those biographical experiences affect parent-teacher-student interactions. Another reading poignantly details the devastating impact for an immigrant child of being unknown --by both her teacher and her classmates. And a third reading delineates how a teacher\u2019s/parent\u2019s faith affects their understanding of public schooling and their zeal for reform.",

In this course, instructor Justin Reich and the MIT Teaching Systems Lab team will help you develop an understanding of the characteristic elements of CBE and how schools are implementing it.\n\nYou will learn why so many educators are excited about CBE and its potential for closing opportunity gaps, as well as challenges and concerns. You will get a closer look at what the implementation of CBE looks and feels like for students, teachers, administrators, families, and community members. You will consider the kinds of system-wide shifts necessary to support this innovation in education.\n\nBy looking at research and hearing from experts and voices in schools, you will leave the course equipped to start or continue conversations about whether CBE is a good fit in your context.\n\nImage: Garrett Beazley \u00a9 MIT Teaching Systems Lab",

Not every school defines CBE the same way, but there are some elements that are included in most definitions. We will share these characteristic elements of CBE and discuss why there is more debate around certain elements. Learners will get an introduction to why educators are excited about experimenting with CBE, as well as concerns and dilemmas they are facing.\n\nUnit 2\n\nIdeally, experimenting with CBE forces schools to have conversations about what learning goals are most important and what performances of understanding best align, as well as conversations about traditional ways student progress is measured. Here we will focus on CBE at the classroom level, hearing from teachers and others regarding topics like pacing, pedagogy, curriculum, classroom organization, and assessment.\n\nUnit 3\n\nCBE presents specific implementation challenges for administrators in areas such as teacher training, technology, community outreach, infrastructure, schedules, transcripts, and standardized testing. In this unit, we will explore those challenges and how some schools are addressing them at a systems level.",

        "syllabus": "Getting to know the curriculum\n-This week introduces the course's emphasis on the relationship between the teacher and the curriculum. The sessions this week deal with three basic topics: the concept of curriculum, the teacher\u2019s curriculum, and adapting to curriculum. These topics will help to broaden your understanding of curriculum and the ways in which it effects students\u2019 experience.\n\nCurriculum development\n-In this week we explore the fundamental issues of curriculum in greater depth, examining mechanisms that underpin the entire system of education in a country. The topics covered are: curriculum formulation, the need for curriculum, curriculum process, and administration of curriculum.\n\nPutting students first\n-The focus of this week is learning before teaching \u2013 putting students first. You will learn about the three-way relationship of the teacher, the curriculum, and the students. As a teacher, you have to be able to contextualize a curriculum that has been made available to you. The curriculum is a general set of content and pedagogic strategies which have to be made real, relevant, and as contextualized as possible for each and every one of the students. The topics to be covered this week are: the three-way relationship, learning as student-specific, theories of student learning, and student-centered teaching.\n\nPutting Curriculum to Work\n-This week we will bring together some important aspects of teaching and learning that were discussed in the previous weeks. The sessions cover issues of interpretation, designing learning activities, planning lessons, and bringing lessons to life.\n\nTheories and Theorists\n-We will begin this week by briefly summarizing some philosophical insights into education which have hugely influenced curriculum. You can become a better teacher by learning about philosophical contributions to the practice of teaching. We present the idea of educational philosophy as a system of beliefs and values that affect thinking about education, how it may be conceived, and how it is engaged with by students and by teachers so as to produce desired outcomes.\n\nOptimizing Curriculum Outcomes\n-In this final week we will focus on four main topics: amplifying the role of curriculum, communities of learning, self-check, and the final dialogue. We will look at Lee Shulman\u2019s theoretical work \u2018pedagogical content knowledge\u2019 (or PCK). Additionally, we will at collaborative learning and take a look at a powerful developing idea - the professional learning community. You will also reassess your knowledge of curriculum through a discussion of six key questions. Finally, we will reflect on what you will take away from the course.",

These are university-level skills but you can work on the foundations of these skills before you get there. Such skills will also help in assessments such as A-levels and extended project work. They are also attributes that employers value in graduates.\nIn this course you will explore some key skills needed for success at university. You will hear what university lecturers have to say about skills their students excel at, or struggle with, from undergraduates about areas they have found difficult and some top tips for coping with the university learning environment.\nAt the end of each week there will be an exercise where you will be self-critical and reflect on your progress. These are such important skills for university because they form the basis of independent learning. Each week you will interact with others on the course, compare progress, help those who might be struggling, gain advice and support if you are struggling, and share your thoughts via discussions.",

How do I deal with related administrative and technical issues? How can tablets support innovative approaches such as personalized or collaborative learning? This course does not only provide guidance on these topics but also provides a forum for you to exchange with your peers on these questions.\nThe course aims to inspire to use tablets to foster innovative teaching and learning. In four modules it provides a general introduction to the use of tablets in schools (Module 1) and then discusses how tablets can support new learning approaches such as content creation, collaborative learning, personalized learning and the flipped classroom model (Modules 2, 3, 4).\nWhile the course will be in English, it will be supported by national course ambassadors who can provide support in your national language throughout the course. Please note that unfortunately there is not an ambassador for every EU country available. Take a look at their profiles further below to see if there is an ambassador for your country (click on their picture to see their profile). ",

It is designed to give you the tools to create meaningful object-based learning activities that can be integrated into a wide variety of curricula. All the strategies covered emphasize literacy and critical thinking skills that connect across disciplines.\n\nModule 2: Close-Looking and Open-Ended Inquiry\n-In this module we will discuss and review the different ways that you can facilitate close-looking with your students and engaging in open-ended, inquiry-based conversation around works of art. Don\u2019t wait to start practicing! Grab a friend or a family member and start leading inquiry-based conversation around a work of art, or anything. As you will see in the Google Hangout video, you can use a digital image or any object that you have around that would lend itself to leading an inquiry-based discussion. These practice sessions are not required but the more you practice, the easier and better your classroom performance will be.\n\nModule 3: Activities as Inquiry\n-This section explores interactive methods that promote an open-ended, two-way exchange of ideas and engage a specific set of skills including close-looking, peer-to-peer learning, creative thinking, and problem-solving.\n\nModule 4: Putting it all Together: Making Connections Across Curriculum\n-In this module we will model ways that you can incorporate inquiry around a work of art into your classroom and make connections to curricula. We will also explore the types of resources that you can access to supplement your lesson development and planning.",

It is special because of the way it has been produced. Our English language and study skills teachers at INTO UEA surveyed and interviewed students who had already successfully completed a course and progressed to study at the University. We asked them about the things that they had found most challenging when they started their university programme. This course has been developed as a result of what those international students told us, as well as the experience INTO UEA colleagues have in preparing international students for university study.\nOver the four weeks of the course you will hear top tips from international students already studying at university in the UK. You will also hear teachers talking about the key skills that international students need to do well. Our aim is to give you the best possible chance of success in your studies.\nEach week there will be videos, articles, quizzes and discussions that will help you develop your study skills. At the end of each week there will be an exercise which will review what has been learned. There will also be the opportunity for you to discuss your ideas with other learners on the course.",

You will also analyse the strengths and weakness of different decision-making mechanismsand become familiar with a wider range of useful tools and resources for integrating ICT\n\nHow does ICT make a difference?\n-This week will enable you to identify different dimensions of change at the school level due to the integration of ICT and to be aware of new opportunities for global participation facilitated by technology. You will also begin to understand the features involved in effective professional development and be aware of how children perceive the use of technology in a school context\n\nPedagogical changes achievable through ICT\n-This week will introduce the primary school teaching community and enable you to contribute to the integration of a range of effective ICT-based practices and pedagogies. In addition we aim to increase understanding of the differences in teaching and learning styles, and how different learning activities can contribute to the depth of learning.\n\n\n\nTechnology opportunities\n-This week we aim to encourage you to know different categories of ICT tools, their affordances and different criteria to be applied when selecting them. As well as be able to analyze the needs for digital content and various strategies how to get it, share, or develop and to be aware of the potential of ICT to support computational thinking, to reflect on the needs, priorities, and future plans for further developing and extending the digital environment.\n\nInspiring examples and implementation concerns\n-This week we hope to enable you to identify the different dimensions of implementation issues, and apply them to your own context and to become aware of problems that can be encountered in using ICT. We also wish you to share and build some solutions to these concerns and problems and consider these solutions to be of different kinds: learning design, infrastructure, negotiation with parents, communities of practice, policies, staff development, pedagogical innovations, differentiation, affordable access, and teaching support.\n\nMaking ICT work\n-This week we aim to explain the pivotal role of the teacher in the ICT-enhanced learning environments and to identify the competencies of the teacher to take up this role effectively in the ICT-enhanced learning environments. As well as explain the conditions for supporting the teachers to take up this role effectively in the ICT-enhanced learning environments",

We will also start getting to know a variety of graduate programs in the U.S., as we will each select a \"target\" graduate program at a U.S. college or university to use as a case study throughout the course. We will offer examples from our institution, the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, where this course was created.\n\nWeek 2: Introducing Yourself Professionally\n-Upon arrival on campus, we'll all have the opportunity to introduce ourselves and our graduate work over and over again. To become well-prepared to seize these opportunities for building solid relationships on our new campuses, we'll focus this week on developing an \"elevator pitch\" or short introduction to who we are, what we are studying, and why.\n\nWeek 3: English for Interactive Learning & Teamwork\n-This week focuses on the many ways in which graduate students work together and with faculty in groups and teams. We'll look at the value of diverse group composition. We will explore language used to negotiate roles and prevent misunderstandings in collaborative settings.\n\nWeek 4: English for Research & Scholarship\n-Of course the primary reason to pursue graduate studies is to learn about and participate in research and scholarship in your field. This week, we'll be looking at framing our own expertise, collaborating with faculty, and conventions around engaging with published scholarly writing.\n\nWeek 5: English in Campus Life\n-In this last week of our course together, we'll turn our attention to the transition to graduate student life on a new campus. We'll identify ways to connect with individuals and groups, and to foster a supportive community around us. We'll cap off the course with a \"final draft\" version of everyone's elevator pitches.",

A stimulating home environment that encourages learning as well as parental engagement in school activities is crucial for a child\u2019s cognitive, social and emotional development.\nBuilding family-school partnerships and engaging parents as learning partners from the early years is therefore essential to improving children\u2019s and young people\u2019s development. Research shows that a multidisciplinary approach, with involvement of parents, children, teachers and professionals from the local community is key to resolving behavioural problems of school children.\nThe course, therefore, aims to support school practitioners in reaching out and working effectively with parents to ensure students\u2019 success at school, and later in life. It addresses a range of areas where school practitioners can build positive relationships with parents and engage them in the learning of students. Throughout the course, participants will develop an activity in one of the areas explored in the course which they can implement in their classroom or school in order to facilitate more effective parental engagement.",

To learn more about the computation and computing concepts that underlie those technologies? We'll be using a problem-based approach to explore interesting ways to teach concepts of networks and the internet, data and analysis, and even algorithms and data representation. Finally, we'll evaluate, critique and improve/personalize an \"unplugged activity\" where students learn how to create the minimal network needed to provide connectivity amongst a set of houses. This activity can be scaled for use in grade levels from 4th grade to 12th grade.\n\nTechnology: Bring Me Some Food!\n-How do you interact with and benefit from technology in a 24 hour period? We'll ask you to track your technology use and reflect on its costs and benefits to you. We'll also start by looking at a problem many people might have in a given 24 hour period -- being hungry and wanting someone to bring them some food! We'll explore several smartphone apps related to this including doordash, yelp, and lyft.\n\nI want my entertainment... NOW!\n-Streaming media has had huge impacts not only on consumer choice, but on who is enabled to produce digital media -- be it entertainment or education. Then we'll look at some of the limitations and possible new advances in this area.\n\nImpacts of Computing and Pedagogy\n-This week our work falls into 2 categories. The impacts computing has had on our lives so far may not be the entire story. The CSTA K-12 standards focus a lot on having students not only look at the past, but consider impacts of future advances. Second, we reflect on core constructivist learning theory -- but with a specific focus on teaching computing concepts.\n\nLesson Plans\n-We'll evaluate a \"CS Unplugged\" lesson plan that supports students in learning how to represent real world map/travel representations in a graph. This lesson plan extends upon the \"Paving a Muddy City\" online simulator you used earlier in the course. We'll walk through a revised lesson plan and ask you to help improve it by added vocabulary and assessment items. You'll be able to contribute to and access a crowdsources set of resources created by other learners in this class!",

        "overview": "\u201cIt depends.\u201d That is what you\u2019ll hear when asking about the U.S. university admission process. With over 4,000 universities in the United States and no standard application system, the U.S. admission process can be confusing for everyone, but especially for students applying from other countries.\n\nThis course will help international students (non-U.S. citizens) and non-native English speakers navigate the U.S. university admission process by offering practical information about the documents and pieces that make up a U.S. university application. More importantly, admission officers will discuss how they use those pieces to decide who is accepted and who is denied, so that you can understand the process beyond the pieces.\n\nBy the end of this course, you will understand application basics that include researching schools, creating a school list, and establishing an application plan. This course will not answer all of your application questions, but it will teach you to ask the right questions of yourself and the universities. Ultimately, you will have all the information you need to start your process the right way, putting you on the path to acceptance.\n\n* Please note, while the English Language Programs are part of the University of Pennsylvania, this is not a course about applying to Penn. Furthermore, this course is intended for international students educated in the national curriculum of their country. While other students are welcome to enroll, the course is not intended for American students or students studying in an American, International Baccalaureate, or Advanced Placement curriculum. The course is also intended for students who do not have access to university counseling \u2013 if you attend a school that offers university counseling, your counselor is the best source of information on applying to university. Finally, this course is for undergraduate (Bachelors degree) freshmen (students who have not attended any university) applicants. Undergraduate transfer applicants, students who have attended a university, will find some of the information helpful, but graduate (Masters and Doctoral) applicants will not.",

        "syllabus": "The U.S. Admissions Process\n-The first step to studying in the USA is to understand the application and admissions process in the U.S. How to apply to colleges and universities in the U.S. is probably very different than the university admissions process in your home country. One big difference is the importance of \u201cfit,\u201d and how fit plays a different role among the 4,000+ U.S. colleges and universities. In this module, you will begin to learn about the U.S. admissions process, including how schools evaluate international applications, U.S. college admission requirements, and how schools decide who to accept (it is not all about SAT or ACT scores like many students think). You will also begin to explore yourself so that you can look beyond the \"top\" colleges and universities to identify schools based on \u201cfit,\u201d a big step toward being accepted into U.S. colleges and universities.\n\nSelf-Assessment\n-The most important part of your college application is you. Before you apply to any U.S. universities, you have to know yourself \u2013 likes, dislikes, strengths, and weaknesses. Once you know yourself, you can look at your application the way a U.S. admissions counselor will look at your application. In this module you will learn how to use self-assessment to examine your application, identifying strengths and weaknesses in both your academic and non-academic qualifications. You will also learn about EducationUSA, a college admissions assistance resource located in your home country.\n\nResearch & Planning\n-It is time to use what you learned about yourself to start the college search and find the schools where you will apply. With 4,000+ colleges and universities in the U.S., picking the right schools for you takes time and strategy. This module will focus on three areas: (1) conducting your research, (2) building your school list, and (3) creating your college application plan. To accomplish these goals you will learn everything from application deadlines to where you can research schools to what the information means and how to use that information to better ensure your success.\n\nThe Pieces of Your Application\n-Your college \u201capplication\u201d is made up of eight individual pieces, including essays, letter(s) of recommendation, test/exam scores (SAT, ACT, TOEFL, & IELTS), and more. In this module you will understand how each piece is viewed individually along with how that piece fulfills admission requirements and contributes to your application as a whole. We will also discuss how to submit the pieces of your application, as well as the timing related to each piece. Understanding the pieces of your application, along with the admission requirements, will help you assemble a stronger application overall.\n\nAdmission Officials Interview Series\n-While these interviews might be long, this information is some of the most valuable in the course. Throughout the course you have learned that U.S. colleges and universities are all different \u2013 different environments, different personalities, and different admission processes. In this module you will hear directly from admission counselors at five schools so that you can see the similarities and differences for yourself. These five schools are from across the U.S. and range from small to large, highly selective to open admission, research focused to liberal arts, and more. The previous parts of the course taught you the theories of U.S. admission, in these interviews you will learn the actual practice from the people who make the admission decisions.",

        "overview": "Effective school leadership has a positive impact on student achievement, teaching quality and staff motivation. Research evidence shows that if leadership is based on a vision that can be shared by all staff, parents and stakeholders, it also plays a crucial role for school development and innovation. Sharing leadership roles and responsibilities among a wider group of staff, and involving parents and pupils, has a positive impact on schools.\nThe Shared Leadership & School Development course therefore explores how school leaders, teachers, and others can support the development of a distributed leadership approach at school level. The course defines distributed leadership and why it is an effective leadership model for schools before going into details and examples of developing such a model at school level. As part of this, the course focuses in particular on the concept of teacher leadership and highlights examples of involving families, students, and partner schools in the shaping of a school.\nYou will gain key theoretical understanding about the concept of distributed leadership and its benefits as well as practical examples of how to implement it. Furthermore, you will evaluate the situation at your own school, actively discuss and exchange on how distributed leadership could be implemented at your school and prepare a development plan identifying next steps to move to a distributed leadership approach at your school or further develop a distributed leadership approach already applied at your school.",

        "overview": "Why do so many students struggle to read and comprehend scientific texts? Most science teachers have witnessed it at least once: a student reads from a textbook or article, proceeding calmly and clearly from sentence to sentence, only to reach the period at the end of the paragraph with little comprehension of what he or she has just read. Even children who learn to read quickly\u2014who begin to devour books or blogs, novels or news stories\u2014often seem to struggle with scientific prose. As a teacher, these struggles raise important questions: Which texts should my students read? What should I do if they struggle to understand? Am I teaching a text too quickly? Too slowly? Will more reading become an uphill battle? Will less reading become a slippery slope on which reading becomes even more difficult? This course is designed to address such concerns, giving teachers the tools to help students read for understanding in science.\nWith the Next Generation Science Standards, the Common Core State Standards for Literacy in Language Arts, the CCSS for Literacy in Science and Technical Subjects, and the continuing expansion of high-stakes testing in our nation\u2019s schools, reading comprehension in science seems more important than ever \u2013 particularly as reading is key to accessing all knowledge and to employment. Students must be able to engage with and read non-fiction texts such as those found in science, trace the steps of key processes, and cite evidence to draw inferences, formulate hypotheses, and support or critique arguments. These skills have always lain at the very heart of the scientific enterprise, but they are often exceptionally challenging to share with our students at the primary and secondary levels. Why?",

        "syllabus": "Inclusive education and special education: Equality and equity\n-This week, we consider what disability inclusion means by exploring different models of disability as well as disability rights and policies. Drawing from the history of special and inclusive education we look at how mainstream schools can move towards becoming inclusive schools and how special education can fit into an inclusive education framework. At the end of this week, there is a graded quiz, where you can check your understanding of the key concepts. Every week, you are invited to reflect on the topics in the discussions where you can talk with others about what this means for your practice as an educator.\n\nSupporting disability inclusion\n-This week focuses on teacher empowerment and what teachers need to know to better support learners with disabilities. We begin by sharing with you what the Teacher Empowerment for Disability Inclusion (TEDI) project's research findings revealed about teachers\u2019 educational needs. This week we hear powerful personal testimonies of individuals living with disabilities about their schooling which highlights the importance of the empowered teacher in their lives when they were learners. At the end of this week, there is a graded peer review and opportunity for reflection through discussion.\n\nSystemic support for educators\n-This week focuses on the systemic support structures that are available to teachers and educators in order to support learners with impairments. A former teacher and two district officers share their experiences of support structures and the roles they had to shape and implement policies within the spaces they found themselves in. We will also explore some insights from the TEDI research project on how teachers feel they are supported. At the end of the week, there is a graded quiz and optional Honours Peer Review assignment where you can explore these topics further.\n\nPrinciples and approaches for disability inclusion\n-This week discusses how to make the curriculum accessible for all - particularly focusing on those with severe to profound disabilities. This includes understanding some of the causes of specific impairments (hearing, visual and intellectual) and their impacts on learning. We also have the pleasure of learning from experts who outline which principles and approaches can be adopted to best support learners with these specific impairments. At the end of the week, there is a graded quiz where you can test your knowledge of what you have learnt, and through a discussion reflect on your own teaching practices.\n\nInclusive teaching\n-In this week, the concept of universal design for learning is introduced as a way of approaching teaching and learning to tackle any problems of exclusion from education. Building on the lectures from last week, this week, experienced teachers describe in some detail what teaching strategies they use in their classrooms to include and support learners with specific impairments. Finally, in the peer review assignment you will be given the chance to create your own plan to support a learner, using the universal design principles.",

On his journey, we will be introduced to reasons teachers avoid technology as well as suggestions for how to overcome some common technology difficulties. In particular, learners will be introduced to the concepts of alignment, learner control, and the importance of being outcomes driven.\n\nModule 2: Enhancing Lesson Planning Using Technology\n-In this module, our young teacher learns about creating a learning management system (LMS) to assist him in the classroom. We are also introduced to nine different categories of technology as well as 6 events of instruction. Events of instruction are introduced to help teachers recognize the need to examine different technologies according to how they can be useful during the lesson planning process.\n\nModule 3: Engaging Students Using Technology\n-In this module, we are introduced to the concept of digital nativity, and students that are both digital natives and non-natives. Throughout the module, our young teacher is given strategies to engage both types of learners.\n\nModule 4: Transforming the Classroom Using Technology\n-In this module, learners are introduced to the interaction between teaching, content, and technology, using the acronym TPACK. Through this acronym, teachers are invited to recognize the ways in which different types of knowledge work together. We are also introduced to an additional acronym: SAMR. This acronym invites teachers to consider how essential the tool is to achieving learning outcomes, and whether it simply replaces an older type of technology, or if it transforms the learning process itself.\n\nModule 5: Focusing on Your Training\n-In this module, our young teacher encounters a final test in the form of marketers that attempt to push technology tools on him and his classroom. We give some final advice about how to deal with the massive numbers of tools that are currently available, and what to do to ensure that the tools that are chosen will truly benefit students.\n\nModule 6: Final Review\n-Each of the concepts covered in Modules 1 - 5 is summarized in the course summary video. Learners watch the video to verify their understanding of the course material. Then, they will proceed to the final checkpoint quiz and peer review assignment.",

This is a critical challenge for elementary school teachers: In 2015, only 36 percent of fourth-graders scored at or above the proficient level on the National Assessment of Educational Progress. Reading competency at fourth grade strongly predicts future success in school, since reading becomes increasingly central to learning in all content areas as students advance to higher grades. This MOOC-Ed is organized around the recommendations of the Foundational Skills to Support Reading for Understanding in Kindergarten Through 3rd Grade Practice Guide, published in July 2016 by the U.S. Department of Education's What Works Clearinghouse. This Practice Guide, developed by a panel of expert researchers and practitioners, provides educators with specific, research-based recommendations for effective teaching practices. It focuses on the foundational skills that enable students to read words, relate those words to their oral language, and read with sufficient accuracy and fluency to understand what they read.",

We then consider, through classroom videos and participant discussion, the many components involved in teaching children to read, and the many skills children need to master to become successful readers. We then turn to the first recommendation from the Practice Guide, which is to further students' speaking and listening vocabulary, language use, and comprehension skills.\nUnit 2: Phonological Awareness and Letter-Sounds\nIn Unit 2, we explore Recommendation 2 in the Foundational Skills Practice Guide, develop awareness of the segments of sound in speech and how they link to letters.\nWe will begin by reviewing the recommendation and core content, phonological awareness and the alphabetic principle. We will let you experience this content as your students would, by playing \"games\" with sounds and letters. Next, we will see it in practice by viewing some teachers facilitating their students' developing phonological awareness and knowledge of letter-sound connections. We will then discuss some related debates about instruction. You will have the opportunity to hear from our expert panel and try this out with your own students.",

This is a critical challenge for elementary school teachers: In 2015, only 36 percent of fourth-graders scored at or above the proficient level on the National Assessment of Educational Progress. Reading competency at fourth grade strongly predicts future success in school, since reading becomes increasingly central to learning in all content areas as students advance to higher grades.\n\nThis MOOC-Ed is organized around the recommendations of the Foundational Skills to Support Reading for Understanding in Kindergarten Through 3rd Grade Practice Guide, published in July 2016 by the U.S. Department of Education&#039;s What Works Clearinghouse.

        "syllabus": "Week 1: Handling Direct Instruction\n-Welcome! This week you will begin by familiarizing yourself with the course. Then, we'll examine the role direct instruction plays in a virtual course. I will clarify what I mean by direct instruction and we will look at ways teachers can use some of the latest video/multimedia tools to 'up' student engagement. By the end of this module, you should have a good idea how you can use technology to meet your students needs and craft a better virtual learning experience for them.\n\nWeek 2: Passing with Communication and Building Relationships\n-Welcome to Week 2! In this module, we will focus on what we do as virtual teachers to establish clear and open lines of communication and how we use that to build relationships with our students. In some ways, it\u2019s no different than a traditional face-to-face teacher, but there are also some significant differences. We will look at how to set up the learning environment so you get to know your students, they get to know each other, and everyone has a clear understanding of what's expected of them and the role they play in your course. We will also examine how technology enables us to personalize learning by providing feedback using a variety of online tools.\n\nWeek 3: Swishing Assignments and Assessments\n-Our goal as teachers is to get our students to take a shot and improve their techniques, so that over time we see their \"shooting percentage\" go up! In order to do this, we must design assignments and assessments that engage our students and challenge them to think deeper and go further than they have done before. Our focus for this third module is to rethink assignments and assessments. We will explore what motivates students to perform and learn how to implement some powerful instructional strategies using free tools that can be used in nearly any virtual class. By the end of this module, you will have at least two \"go to\" techniques that will have the virtual nets in your classes swishing with artifacts of meaningful learning. You will also have the opportunity to submit your assignment and evaluate three of your classmates' work.\n\nWeek 4: Rebounding for At-Risk and Underperforming Students\n-Your course is underway, the discussion boards are buzzing with activity and your students are working diligently to produce some exceptional work. Watch out! If you are not actively searching for students hanging out on the sidelines or hiding under the bleachers, you may be forfeiting the greatest joy of your career. This week is going to be a little different. We are going to turn our focus to the students who are often lost, ignored, or troubled. We will define who an at-risk student is, examine some effective strategies for teaching students who are at-risk and we will hear from some educators who know how to help them rebound and score.\n\nWeek 5: Your Best Defense is a Good Community\n-Welcome to our final week of class. We will finish our course by going back to one of the basics: Community. How can a virtual teacher build an inclusive and thriving community with their students, parents and other teachers and why is that vital to a successful online learning environment? We will compare the differences and similarities of an online class community and a face-to-face one and focus on strategies to make our virtual courses more human. Enjoy your week and thank you for learning with us!",

        "syllabus": "Why is Online Teaching Important + Open and Institutionally Supported Technologies\n-'Module 1: Why is Online Teaching Important' is about understanding where you are in the current educational landscape, and determining where you want to be. We will explore why online teaching is relevant to your teaching practice, and you\u2019ll have an opportunity to reflect upon the opportunities and challenges you face in your own context. 'Module 2: Open and Institutionally Supported Technologies' focuses on helping you understand the benefits and restrictions of both broad categories of technologies. We\u2019re all familiar with different social media technologies, and many of us will be aware of larger institutional online learning systems. In this module we will ask you to think about the reasons why you might want to use freely available online tools for your teaching - or your institution's learning management system. Important considerations such as which types of technologies are suitable for a range of different activities will also be explored.\n\nPlanning Online Learning + Online Learning Activities\n-'Module 3: Planning Online Learning' will explore the importance of planning online learning from a pedagogical perspective rather than a technology driven one. Careful planning is one of the most important aspects of teaching online, and success often depends upon taking the time to consider all of the different aspects of the online learning experience before you begin. The content and activities will explore the concepts of constructive alignment, choosing which aspects of a class are best done online or face-to-face, building digital literacy capabilities within your students, and examining your own motivations for wanting to teach online in the first place. 'Module 4: Online Learning Activities' will identify important considerations you need to keep in mind when developing online learning activities for your students. We will offer advice about how to plan an online activity, and help you think about which may be appropriate for your own students. When you are new to the process, understanding which online technology best supports different learning activities can be daunting. This module, along with a range of case studies, and activities, will explore the relationship between different technologies and specific activities in more depth.\n\nOnline Assessment Strategies + Online Resources\n-'Module 5: Online Assessment Strategies' discusses the notions of formative and summative assessment in online contexts. We will also explore benefits and considerations that you'll need to keep in mind if you're considering adopting an online assessment strategy in your own teaching, and how using technology can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the assessment process. 'Module 6: Online Resources' discusses the benefits of using open educational resources (OER), and other online resources in your classes. We will also identify issues to be aware of when using resources that you discover, in terms of licensing and Creative Commons. You will be given the chance to explore several examples of online resources via the activities and associated resources for the module. How to evaluate the effectiveness and appropriateness of resources you find online is also explored.\n\nEngaging and Motivating Students + Evaluation Strategies\n-'Module 7: Engaging and Motivating Students' explores various strategies for engaging and motivating your students in a range of different online learning scenarios. It discusses the important roles that curriculum design, activity structure, the relevance of the chosen technology, and effective time management play in creating an enthusiasm for learning in your students. 'Module 8: Evaluation Strategies' examines the importance of evaluating your online teaching practice to ensure that it is effective, and to give you an opportunity to constantly improve. This is especially important when you are first developing an online teaching practice, or when you are trying something new for the first time. We will explore an evaluation strategy based upon four reflective angles: self reflection, peer observations, student feedback, and theory. The module also introduces the concept of learning analytics as an informative tool to enable up to the minute evaluation of your online class.\n\nQuestion and Answers\n-Simon and Negin answered the top questions asked of them in previously run versions of this course via video. Although from previous courses, the questions raised and the discussions that follow, are very relevant, and they may answer some questions that you have about the course. In the videos Simon and Negin, did reference learners' names and the week in the course, but this is not important in this version of the course. These Q&A videos have been collated according to their relevance to the Modules of the course.",

Our first module, \u201cSignificant Learning\u201d will look closely at these moments, first through the eyes of High Tech High students and then through those of our course\u2019s participants. We ask that you use this data to identify the principles of significant learning and to discuss what these might mean for your own practice.\n\nThe Day-To-Day\nThe average student day looks very different at High Tech High that it does in traditional schools. In this module, students will talk about how their daily schedule has impacted their education. We will explore the reasons why a learning schedule within a school setting is so important and how you can incorporate student voice into its design. Finally we will charge course participants with designing a schedule for their ideal school. The will be shared with other course participants who will be asked to provide feedback.\n\nHow We Show What We Know\nAssessment is one of the most interesting aspects of project based learning. Students working in a multidisciplinary education style logically answer the question of \u201cwhat have you learned?\u201d in a multi-faceted manner. To assess students within their learning environments we use quite a few different models of engagement, and some we are even developing as we speak.In this module you will see how students learn at High Tech High as well as how teachers bring student voice into the assessment process. You will look at exhibitions, digital portfolios, and student led comments that are crafted by both the instructor and the students in tandem.",

Teachers want feedback about their teaching, but encounter three problems:\n1. They don't get much.  The principal or department head doesn't visit very often.  And there\u2019s no built-in structure at their school for peer observation.\n2. The feedback isn't helpful or actionable.\nSometimes it's just happy talk -- 98% of American teachers are rated satisfactory -- and while everyone likes a pat on the back, evaluations that say \"you were wonderful\" don't make better teachers.  Or sometimes the feedback is critical in ways that don\u2019t present clear next steps.  Sometimes it's vague or just plain wrong.  \n3. Some teachers can be defensive.  \n(Yes, we know \u2013 only SOME people are defensive, but not YOU.  You are different.

It will provide math refresher materials covering a wide range of mathematical concepts together with information about success in college.\nIncoming college students are typically placed in college math courses based on placement exam scores. Students often take these placement exams with minimal preparation or after a long break since their last math class. The study materials in the course will help students prepare for placement exams, and higher scores mean fewer required math courses in college. Students who have already taken a placement exam (such as the ACT) can also use these materials to study and then retest, hopefully scoring higher. College students who have started, but not finished their math courses, can also retake a placement exam and possibly skip a math class. The course will also be valuable for anyone who just wants to refresh their math skills. The provided study materials are individualized based on a student\u2019s current knowledge. Each student will be provided a customized learning path that maximizes efficiency so that study time is spent where it\u2019s needed most.\nBeyond math content, the course will also provide college success material such as test-taking strategies, new student orientation, and study techniques. All of this material can be accessed separately from the math content so even if a student is already placed highly in math, or has tested out of it completely, the course will provide valuable information to help the student orient to college and to get the most out of the college experience.",

El aprendizaje activo permite a los participantes asumir su educaci\u00f3n con responsabilidad y autonom\u00eda, lo cual representa una excelente oportunidad para su formaci\u00f3n tanto acad\u00e9mica como personal pues, ante la necesidad de abordar los contenidos desde su experiencia y con sus propios medios, desarrollan habilidades que les permiten manejar mejor sus conocimientos y resolver eficazmente los problemas.En cuanto trata al contenido del m\u00f3dulo, en la lecci\u00f3n inicial hay un planteamiento general del curso para que conozcas sus objetivos y una infograf\u00eda a detalle en la Biblioteca de Archivos. En las lecciones posteriores reflexionamos sobre las condiciones del proceso de aprendizaje, repasamos algunas caracter\u00edsticas del Aprendizaje Activo junto con su aplicaci\u00f3n y consideramos la importancia de dicha estrategia desde el \u00e1mbito de la innovaci\u00f3n citando algunas de sus ventajas. Las lecciones se complementan con actividades que medir\u00e1n tu adquisici\u00f3n de conocimientos. Al final hay una actividad sumativa para comenzar a construir el instrumento que evaluar\u00e1 el aprendizaje al final del curso.Tenemos la seguridad de que esta experiencia ser\u00e1 muy grata y constructiva para tu formaci\u00f3n.

Los procesos de innovaci\u00f3n requieren miradas externas para valorar los alcances que pueden llegarse a tener y las posibilidades de mejora. En el mismo sentido, el aprendizaje activo requiere esos procesos de reflexi\u00f3n y transferencia para estimular la comprensi\u00f3n y la construcci\u00f3n abierta del conocimiento. \u00a1Bienvenidos al m\u00f3dulo 4!\n\nEvaluar y mejorar el dise\u00f1o innovador de aprendizaje activo\n-En este m\u00f3dulo conocer\u00e1s los aspectos de evaluaci\u00f3n de un dise\u00f1o de ambiente de aprendizaje activo con integraci\u00f3n de tecnolog\u00edas emergentes, con el fin de mejorar el dise\u00f1o y las posibilidades de generaci\u00f3n de aprendizaje activo.

This highly interactive course will introduce students to the fundamental concepts of computer science. The course will be structured to encourage students to think computationally and enjoy problem solving. New York City\u2019s companies, museums, art and architecture will be used as examples to emphasize the ubiquitous role of computing and programming concepts in the world around us.\nThe course will delve into object- oriented problem solving and design using the Java  programming language. Students will have access to practice problems that will help them learn to program without spending hours on finding and fixing syntax errors. These will include online multiple-choice questions in the style of those on the AP exam, mixed-up code that the user drags into the correct order, fill in the blank code and audio tours of the code.\nTopics include problem solving, programming design strategies and  data structures, algorithms, role of computation in real-world applications like smart phones, google glass and robots. This material may be used for self-study and as a preview by students and teachers considering the September 2015 offering of the course.\nLearn more about our High School and AP* Exam Preparation Courses",

Today, our tools for communication and representation have been widely expanded by digital tools. For these reasons, we need to extend our literacy pedagogy to encompass literacies in the plural, including a wider range of modes of meaning than alphabetic text alone.\n\nModule 2: Making Meaning by Reading + Making Meaning by Writing + Making Visual Meaning\n-This module begins with an overview of the conventional focus of literacy pedagogy \u2013 reading and writing. In its second half, the module applies a parallel set of tools to analysis of visual meanings.\n\nModule 3: Making Spatial, Tactile, and Gestural Meanings + Making Audio and Oral Meanings + Literacies to Think and to Learn\n-In this third module of the course, we examine spatial, tactile, gestural, audio, and oral meanings \u2013 all today part of a wider repertoire of teaching and learning that we call \"literacies\" in the plural, or \"multiliteracies.\" In the final section of the module, we explore how we use literacies to think in characteristically \"academic\" ways. In this sense, literacies play a critical supportive role in the learning process.\n\nModule 4: Literacies and Learner Differences + Literacies Standards and Assessment\n-The final module of the course examines the question of learner differences \u2013 including literacies learning at different age levels and second language learning. We also explore strategies for differentiated instruction. Finally, we investigate the range of assessment strategies that can be used to diagnose learner needs, offer feedback during the learning process, and evaluate learning outcomes.",

It includes a variety of voices and perspectives from the College of Education at the University of Illinois. Mary Kalantzis and Bill Cope offer a historical and conceptual overview of the field, classified broadly under the terms \"behaviorism,\" \"brain developmentalism,\" and \"social cognitivism.\" This is followed by four quite different practical examples of educational psychology at work. Dorothy Espelage discusses her work on the social and emotional conditions of learning in her research into bullying at school. Denice Hood gives an example of the application of psychology to educational counseling. George Reese speaks about \"productive struggle\" in learning. And finally, Joe Robinson-Cimpian discusses the application of quantitative psychology to analyze test results for the purposes of school and curricular placement.\n\nBrain Developmentalism and Social Cognitivism\n-In this module, we explore the main theories and theorists in approaches to educational psychology that we call \"brain developmentalism\" and \"social cognitivism.\"\n\nSocial and Emotional Conditions of Learning and Student Development\n-This module and the following one present four leading educational psychologists from the University of Illinois demonstrating the range of applications of educational psychology. In this module, Dorothy Espelage explores the socio-emotional conditions of learning, with a particular focus on her research into bullying. Then, Denice Hood discusses student development.\n\nProductive Struggle in Learning and Quantitative Psychology\n-Two more, quite varied applications of educational psychology: George Reese discusses productive struggle, and Joe Robinson-Cimpian the application of quantitative educational psychology at a systems level.",

To learn more about the computation and computing concepts that underlie those technologies? We'll be using a problem-based approach to explore interesting ways to teach concepts of networks and the internet, data and analysis, and even algorithms and data representation. Additionally, this course features a series called \"Career Explorations\" -- resources you can use to help students broaden their ideas of future career opportunities. Finally, we'll explore several lesson plans supporting online learning resources around data science and html programming (don't worry -- not prior programming experience is required!).\n\nGetting a Job in New Ways\n-How has getting a job changed due to the Internet and ever growing amounts of information we choose to make available online? What new opportunities or flexibility are available because of the digital nature of much of our work? We'll explore this and some of fundamentals behind database storage and access that helps match us to possible jobs!\n\nPhysical Ties to Work\n-How have cheap computers and \"always available\" Internet connectivity changed how and when we can work? What about the cloud -- is it just for storage? Finally, we'll look at two impacts on careers -- working in a truly \"global\" company and managing the updates of software that we seem to get all the time!\n\nAdvancing your career in the technical world\n-How will the workplace of the future be different? Will workers be expected to constantly learn new things just to stay employable? How might that happen? Will machines be taking over our jobs? This is currently the subject of a LOT of discussion. Although exploring the technology behind machine learning and artificial intelligence is appropriate, we have already covered that in another course (Course 2 - Data). Instead here we'll look at the new \"career\" of data science and explore a tool you can use with students to give them a first introduction -- no programming needed!\n\nImpacts of Computing and Pedagogy\n-Technology and the Internet is changing not only what kinds of jobs we can get, but how we can stay trained and train for new jobs our entire life. This week you will find a resource for exploring the impacts of computing on career or work -- that you think would be useful with YOUR students. Additionally we'll reflect on how cognitive load can cause challenges when teaching computing and explore and critique a code.org lesson on learning HTML.",

Combined with increased numbers of refugees in many countries, this has led to greater interpersonal cross cultural encounters and heightened cultural concerns. All school levels are facing complex challenges in adjusting their services to an increasingly diverse student population, irrespective of their background. It is therefore of great importance that employees at all school levels are culturally competent and can understand and adapt their services when working with people with diverse cultural backgrounds.\n\nThe aim of this course is to help the students develop intercultural competence by broadening their understanding of different cultures and different identities, as well as promoting students\u00b4 awareness of their own culture, learning from the experiences of international educators as well as professionals at the municipality level in the Nordic countries.\n\nAn added value is that the course is open to participants from different parts of the world, which creates a cross-cultural learning and teaching environment.\n\nBy the end of this course you should have learned practical intercultural skills and increased your understanding of intercultural competence; how to talk about and address intercultural opportunities and challenges, how to develop strategies to respond to diverse and hybrid identities in a fairer way, and how to promote social justice in education and respect for different languages, preventing conflicts and enhancing societal cohesion.",

        "syllabus": "The importance of relationships for educational settings\n-Relationships are critical to everything we do. They impact on our learning and how we see the curriculum and its assessment. They make a difference to our learning by ourselves and with others. They will enable us to work well, or not so well, with other people in the school. This week we will look in detail at what relationships are and how they are formed. We look back briefly at something that was discussed in course five, that is, how to support the development of a growth mindset. We hope that right from the start you will be discussing the course content with another educator. Since our relationships for so much of the time involve other people, it is important to think about these things with others to enable us to practice some of the things that are talked about in the course.\n\nDeveloping positive teacher-student relationships\n-This week we are going to focus on establishing relationships with students. We will start by considering the connections between how and what we think and how we behave. Sometimes we behave habitually, but sometimes, if we want to change our habits, we have to consciously make decisions about what to think or how to act. We will discuss how these two types of behaviour play out in the classroom and look at why one type is more productive. To take this a little bit further, we will explore the role that questions play in learning. We will also look at some of the strategies that you can use to develop positive relationships in the classroom, remembering that students are forming a range of relationships: relationship with themselves, with learning, with the curriculum content, with the teacher, with other students and with the wider community. Finally, we are going to talk about the need to behave ethically in the classroom, treating students with respect and ensuring that no harm comes to them. At the end of the week, you will write a short essay where you will consider the factors involved in establishing relationships and think about activities that you can use to improve student learning.\n\nWorking with your colleagues and school leaders\n-This week we will focus on the concept of school improvement and effectiveness. There are several important factors that contribute to the success of a school. We will identify what these factors are, and look at each of them in detail. We start by looking at relationships, especially your relationships with your colleagues and school leaders. This will include a study of teacher unions and teacher associations, which both have a role in building professional relationships. Teacher unions offer a platform for development that will bring about educational reform. Next we will look at trust. We will explore what the concept of trust encompasses, and consider how certain behaviours can help to build trust. Finally, we look at working with leaders, teachers, and support staff. Here we will be looking at establishing Professional Learning Communities. At the end of this week we hope that you will be prepared to establish Professional Learning Communities and enhance you professional development.\n\nThe importance of parent involvement for student success\n-This week we will consider the importance of establishing good relationships with the parents of your students. We will focus on why we need to involve parents in the education of their children and how we can go about it. The first two lectures are themed on the statement \u2018The parent is the child\u2019s first teacher\u2019. These lectures focus on the important role that parents play in their child\u2019s learning. We know that having children well prepared for the first day of school is an important first step for their learning. Teachers can play a role in reaching out to parents and giving them the information they need to give students the best chance of being successful. Weeks three and four look at the work of Joyce Epstein and her colleagues and their six different ways in which parents can be productively involved in their child\u2019s education. These include the important roles of parenting, having good communication with the school, volunteering to do things in the school, helping their child learn at home, helping the school to make decisions about what it will do, and actively being involved in the community. At the end of this week you will be asked to write a short essay where you will consider the factors involved in establishing relationships with either other teachers and school administrators or parents.\n\nIt takes a whole village to educate a child: Working with your community\n-This week we consider the importance of looking beyond the school and establishing relationship with the outside community. Students are much more likely to do well if the community values education and provides good policies, appropriate levels of funding, and appropriate training for teachers. We will consider the difference between a regular school and a community school that involves its local community and considers it be a part of the school. We will look at some of the things that a community needs in order to support student learning and explore some ways in which schools can establish partnerships with their community. We will also consider 40 developmental assets that are related to student learning and success, as identified by the Search Institute in the United States. We also reflect on the importance of dialogue as a means of helping each other learn. This is one reason why we have been encouraging you to work in partnership with a colleague \u2013 either in your own setting or online \u2013 as you work through the ideas in this course. We hope you will either use professional conversations in your school setting or work with others online to enable dialogue that will help you learn.\n\nRecognising diversity: Social, Cultural and Values differences in the school\n-This week you are going to have the opportunity to think about the issue of diversity in the classroom. Some of you might think that your classroom is not really a diverse place because all of the students come from your home country. However, diversity goes way beyond issues of nationality and culture. Diversity can include gender, socio-economic background, motivation to learn, and many other factors. We need to consider diversity very carefully if we are to have a classroom that is responsive to the various needs of our students.",

        "syllabus": "Why SEL and the teacher?\n-Here we introduce what SEL is and why it is important for all teachers. We elaborate the need for the teacher to enhance her/his knowledge of self, especially his/her own social and emotional terrain. A guiding premise is that deeper teacher self-understanding facilitates and enhances deeper student relations and greater chances for the transformative possibilities for student and teacher. A related premise is that by examining our deeply held cherished beliefs and emotional responses to situations and texts, we create opportunities for further insights into why and the ways we teach.\n\nWhat does teaching do to teachers?\n-Here we further elaborate the need for the teacher to enhance her/his knowledge of self, especially his/her emotional responses as well as deeply held beliefs.\n\nSadness and despair in teaching\n-The value of reflection on and examination of sadness, despair, and related emotions in teaching is seen as one example of an enhanced \u201cgranularity\u201d offered to teachers through reflection on emotions.\n\nJoy, passion, and enjoyment in teaching\n-The value of reflection on and examination of joy and passion, as well as other related emotions in teaching is seen as another example of an enhanced \u201cgranularity\u201d that can be gained by teachers through a reflection on emotions.\n\nGrit and wholeness in teaching\n-By contrasting \u201cgrit\u201d and \u201cwholeness\u201d in teaching and learning we explore further the value we as individuals place on these two orienting dispositions.",

In this course we will explore the different models of blended learning and dive into key issues that impact students, teachers, and schools.

A few of the key topics will include:\n\n- The role of the student and how to support students in the transition from traditional to blended learning\n- Implications for teachers in their day-to-day work and overall role\n- Impact on the way schools are designed including staffing models, use of time, hardware/software selection, and the use of data\n- Implementation challenges, potential solutions, and the remaining open questions\n\nWe will live by the attributes of blended learning in this course, encouraging students to take quizzes at the beginning of the module to assess their understanding and skip material they already know. Overall, we will take a hand-on approach and the course will culminate in participants prototyping their own blended learning model.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about how to best leverage technology in education and rethink the way we run schools, join this MOOC and encourage your colleagues to do the same. Become a part of this growing movement and learn first-hand how blended learning can help provide students a more personalized learning experience.",

        "syllabus": "An Introduction to Assessment Theory and Practice\n-What is the purpose of assessment? Research has shown that opinions on this differ around the world. In this week\u2019s general introduction to assessment theory and practice, you can compare your own experience of assessment with some contrasting experiences from different parts of the world. We will take a clear look at how educational assessment integrates and links curriculum, teaching, and learning. We will then look at cultural factors that may influence the teaching practices of your workplace.\n\nThe nature of feedback in improving teaching and learning\n-Feedback can vary greatly in its effectiveness. In the lectures this week we will identify the key characteristics of good (and bad) feedback. We will explore the practice of incorporating feedback into teaching. Teachers and students have their own views on what constitutes effective feedback. Understanding these views can help you to decide how you should give feedback to your own students. We will ask you to consider how you can best provide feedback to minority students. By the end of the week you should be able to generate your own examples of effective feedback for students.\n\nReporting student achievement\n-Welcome back to our third week of exploring ideas connected to assessment. In the lectures this week, we explore current approaches to reporting and raise important questions about their validity. We will consider the strengths and weaknesses of standardized test scores and point you to effective techniques for writing reports and giving feedback that will actually help students and pupils improve their learning. We will give you tools for use in your own practice and encourage you how reporting practices used with majority groups might need to be modified for use with parents from minority groups.\n\nGuidelines for developing and using objectively answered question procedures\n-This week we describe specific techniques for designing assessment tools. The assessment tool that we will focus on is multiple-choice questions (MCQs), however we will present a number of different formats. You will be given practical advice and tools for creating a variety of good test questions. The key point to note is that unless such objectively-scored questions are written well, getting them right will not be an indicator of knowledge or skill in the domain being assessed. Test-wiseness (i.e., knowing how to answer such questions) increases test scores but this is no guarantee students actually understand more. Hence, care and attention needs to be paid to how test questions are written. Stay active \u2013 and enjoy the learning this week.\n\nGuidelines for developing and using human judgement scoring procedures\n-Last week we focused on assessments that could be scored against agreed correct answers. We will now look at judgement-based assessments. The main assessment method used in teaching has changed from objective-style to using judgement-based assessment. This change has brought forward some new issues for us to consider. We will introduce you to challenges that are inherent in designing and evaluating student performance in open-ended formats in the first lecture. In the next two lectures we will focus on two assessment tools that are often used under judgement-based conditions: the rubric and the essay. In the last lecture, we will explore the concepts of moderation and inter-rater reliability. The topics for this week require you to grapple with notions of accuracy, quality, reliability, validity, and error. By the end of the week you should be able to design a valid and reliable assessment task and corresponding marking scheme (rubric).\n\nGuidelines for developing and using procedures that involve students in assessment\n-In this final week we will define two assessment practices that involve student participation: self-assessment and peer assessment. We will provide you with exemplars of both kinds of assessment for your own personal use, and point you to important issues that you will need to consider when preparing your own assessments. By the end of this week you should be able to create peer and self-assessment tasks that facilitate learning for children you teach.",

Por ello, todos los interesados en la educaci\u00f3n b\u00e1sica en contextos rurales podr\u00e1n identificar sus particularidades, distinguir aspectos cr\u00edticos que podr\u00e1n ayudar a mejorar los aprendizajes, y generar planes estrat\u00e9gicos para influir sobre el futuro de los ni\u00f1os y de la comunidad en la que la escuela est\u00e1 inserta.\n\nVivir lejos de los centros urbanos no puede dejar a los ni\u00f1os sin acceso a las competencias claves que debe brindar la educaci\u00f3n b\u00e1sica. Los responsables de pol\u00edticas p\u00fablicas deben contribuir a asegurar la calidad de las escuelas de contextos rurales y directores, docentes y comunidades tienen un rol fundamental en la construcci\u00f3n de esta posibilidad en el d\u00eda a d\u00eda escolar.  Todos ellos pueden encontrar recursos \u00fatiles en este curso.\n\nEste curso forma parte de la Especializaci\u00f3n en Educaci\u00f3n B\u00e1sica en contextos rurales, aunque puede ser realizado en forma independiente de la especializaci\u00f3n.\n\nEl curso ser\u00e1 especialmente \u00fatil para docentes, directores o actores comunitarios comprometidos con la gesti\u00f3n escolar.",

Information comes at us faster than ever before, and our ability to solve problems depends on us being able to make sense of and synthesize this information. We must also design new solutions using all available technology and tools.\nDigital-age problem solving combines three key skills and concepts essential to understanding and solving problems in the information age: data literacy, design thinking, and computational thinking. Data literacy is the ability to analyze, interpret, and tell stories using complex sets of data. Design thinking is the ability to understand problems and develop creative solutions. Computational thinking is the process of expressing solutions so that humans and computers can understand them.\nThroughout this MOOC-Ed, you'll have the opportunity to dig into digital-age problem solving, engage with its component skills and concepts, and learn how to integrate them into your instructional practice. This course will not be heavy on coding, and you won't need to know any code going in - it will focus on how to integrate digital-age problem solving in a practical way into your classroom.",

You'll also have the opportunity to explore these concepts on your own, share with the group, and brainstorm applications to your practice.\nUnit 3: Making Sense of Problems\nThis unit will transition from identifying problems to breaking them down in order to determine possible solutions. We'll focus on the \"Defining the Problem\" phase of the design process, with a specific focus on the computational thinking skills of problem decomposition, abstraction, and parallelization. You'll experience these skills by completing a simulated activity with a problem that you select, and you'll have an opportunity to brainstorm how you can use these concepts in your classroom.",

We visit the places where new ideas and practices were spawned, and we look at some of their unanticipated consequences.\nFrom there, we seek answers to a second question: What are the best ways of lifting the performance of American schools to a higher level? To explore these questions, we look at ideas and proposals of those who want to save our schools\u2014be it by reforming the teaching profession, holding schools accountable, or giving families more school choices. In interviews with reform proponents and independent experts, we capture the intensity of the current debate. In the end, we do not find any silver bullets that can magically lift schools to a new level of performance, but we do pinpoint the pluses and minuses of many new approaches to education reform.",

Undergraduate programs of three or four year duration are offered in Humanities, Social Sciences and Sciences. 40,000 Degree Colleges provide most of the graduate level workforce to Government and Private Organizations in India. The quality of learning of their graduates will make a major difference to the wealth generating and service providing abilities of these organizations. Courses in Humanities, Social Sciences and Sciences (nearly 30 credits out of 160 credits) are also offered in all undergraduate engineering programs in more than 4000 higher education institutions. The quality of learning of the graduates of these programs determines the quality of their placements. While there has been significant increase in the last few decades in our understanding of how people learn, there has not been much intersection of this knowledge with the instructional practices at institutions of higher learning. The dominant instructional method still remains lecturing/one-way information transfer. Employers, Regulatory Bodies and Accreditation Agencies in India want the graduates attain a set of Program Outcomes (knowledge, skills and attitudes) to be identified by the Institutions offering the General Programs. These Program Outcomes need to be discipline agnostic. The curriculum of a program decides the nature of learning experiences including the courses, projects, field work, internships, and co-curricular and extra-curricular activities.",

Especially in open learning settings like the online courses offered at the Teacher Academy. These courses are organised as MOOCs \u2013 Massive Open Online Courses \u2013 meaning they are open to anyone who wants to join. This results in hundreds and even thousands of participants joining a course. If you are not used to learning in such an environment, this can be a challenge. In this short self-paced course, we therefore introduce you to five key strategies to help you make the most out of our courses and support your online learning in general.\nThe following five strategies will be addressed on the course:\nStrategy 1: Reflect on how you learn\nStrategy 2: Plan your learning\nStrategy 3: Use a learning diary\nStrategy 4: Build a personal learning network\nStrategy 5: Find support\n ",

The new standards specifically describe the importance of students understanding the reasoning of others and engaging in meaningful conversations using evidence for claims. Yet this type of student-to-student interaction tends to be rare in classrooms. Common classroom teaching activities such as whole class discussions, jigsaws, and think-pair-shares can have the appearance of constructive interactions, but they often do not provide adequate opportunities for all students to engage in back-and-forth dialog. This short course looks closely at student-to-student conversations and addresses ways to improve students' abilities to engage in the types of interactions described in the new standards.\nThis course consists of four main sessions with three weeks between each session in order to provide extra time for application and reflection. The learning in this course relies heavily on participant contributions and comments, especially in the team collaboration setting. Participants will be expected to complete both team and individual assignments for all sessions. The sessions and assignments are designed for participants who teach or have access to classrooms in which they can gather samples of students\u2019 conversation during lessons. Finally, we include resources and tasks for instructional coaches and others who support teachers and build school-wide capacity.\n \nPlease note that this is a slightly modified version of a previous course offered in Spring, 2014.

        "description": "The Common Core State Standards and Next Generation Science Standards emphasize improving the quality of student-to-student discourse as a major feature of instruction. The new standards specifically describe the importance of students understanding the reasoning of others and engaging in meaningful conversations using evidence for claims. Yet this type of student-to-student interaction tends to be rare in classrooms. Common classroom teaching activities such as whole class discussions, jigsaws, and think-pair-shares can have the appearance of constructive interactions, but they often do not provide adequate opportunities for all students to engage in back-and-forth dialog. This short course looks closely at student-to-student conversations and addresses ways to improve students&#039; abilities to engage in the types of interactions described in the new standards.\n\nThis course consists of four main sessions with three weeks between each session in order to provide extra time for application and reflection. The learning in this course relies heavily on participant contributions and comments, especially in the team collaboration setting. Participants will be expected to complete both team and individual assignments for all sessions. The sessions and assignments are designed for participants who teach or have access to classrooms in which they can gather samples of students\u2019 conversation during lessons. Finally, we include resources and tasks for instructional coaches and others who support teachers and build school-wide capacity.\n \nPlease note that this is a slightly modified version of a previous course offered in Spring, 2014. This course is targeted towards secondary school teachers.\n\nWe hope you will join us on this exciting journey.",

Learning English can be tricky, and in this class you'll focus on some of those tricky issues. You'll get clear explanations about the difficult grammar points and practice in using them correctly.\n\nTeaching Nouns, Articles, and Quantifiers\n-This week, you'll learn about teaching tricky nouns, articles, and quantifiers. Students get confused about when to put \"a\" or \"the\" in front of a noun and when to put nothing in front of the noun. In this module, you'll learn new ways to help them with this difficult grammar, and you'll have an opportunity to create your own lesson and submit a video demonstrating your teaching skills.\n\nTeaching Gerunds, Infinitives, and Requests and Permission\n-This week will learn more about teaching tricky grammar. First, you'll learn about teaching gerunds and infinitives. Then you'll learn about teaching two concepts with modals--making requests and asking for permission--grammar that English learners often make mistakes with.\n\nTeaching Confusing Word Forms\n-You've learned about teaching some tricky grammar, but there are other things that make English hard to learn. This week, you'll learn about teaching some word forms that cause confusion. You'll also get another chance to practice what you've learned and demonstrate your teaching skills by sharing a video of your teacher talk.\n\nTeaching Phrasal Verbs and Collocations\n-In the final week of the course, you'll learn about teaching phrasal verbs and collocations. This tricky grammar also causes problems for students even at higher levels. You'll get one more chance to create an effective activity for students to practice this grammar and to create a video demonstrating your teacher talk.",

Secondary school students often learn differently to younger students. This can require a different teaching approach.\nOn this course, you will learn how to support effective learning experiences in secondary schools, exploring the different ways secondary school students learn. You will also reflect on your own values and biases to improve your confidence and working practice.\nBy the end of the course you should feel more confident in your ability to support secondary school students.\nThis course is ideal for teaching assistants in secondary schools. It will also be of interest to teachers returning to work, newly qualified teachers, unqualified staff, as well as providing a refresher for current teachers. Parents of children in schools may also find this course useful in helping them to support and encourage their children\u2019s learning.\nThis course focusses on teaching in secondary schools.

We\u2019ll cover these questions and more in this module! Learn how nested repeats work by making dance instructions, solving programming puzzles, and creating a program. Prepare for class discussions around challenging questions about nested repeats.\n\nMore Nested Repeats & Events\n-Be prepared for teaching nested repeats with code.org\u2019s Bee and Zombie programming challenges, and get ready to learn about events! Find out how to grab your students\u2019 attention with events, and practice your understanding by imagining: what if you could control someone with a game controller? Learn more about events by playing with programming puzzles and creating your own program.\n\nMore Events & Variables\n-In this module, we\u2019ll explore how events are taught in the classroom and go through another code.org challenge: this time, we\u2019re creating the game of Bounce (or Pong), which is just like air hockey! We\u2019ll also introduce how variables are placeholders for data by displaying them as a real-world placeholders: envelopes. Work on getting comfortable with variables in a variety of programming puzzles.\n\nMore Variables\n-After working through some tricky examples of changing variables, we\u2019re ready to bring variables to your classroom! First, we\u2019ll cover a more thorough lesson plan for the \u201cvariables as envelopes\u201d metaphor. Then, we\u2019ll head back to the code.org Artist environment to show the true power of variables and how much they can affect our drawings!\n\nEquity & Pedagogy\n-We take a break from programming concepts to ensure that your classroom environment encourages a healthy learning environment. Learn how to make fun assignments a little more approachable by using Parsons\u2019 problems, and explore how you can make your computer lab a respectful and supportive environment for all, especially students that might be underrepresented.",

        "overview": "Descripci\u00f3n del curso\nEl uso frecuente y variado de los tel\u00e9fonos celulares por parte de la gran mayor\u00eda de los ni\u00f1os y j\u00f3venes de hoy, presenta un reto creciente a los docentes, quienes buscan canalizar estos usos hacia fines educativos o bien los perciben como distractores para los educandos debido a su afici\u00f3n a las redes sociales. La presencia de estos dispositivos dentro y fuera de las aulas ofrece nuevas oportunidades pedag\u00f3gicas, pero tambi\u00e9n facilita instancias para conectarse educativamente con el mundo digital de los j\u00f3venes.\n\nEl aprendizaje m\u00f3vil, personalizado, cooperativo, interactivo y ubicado en el contexto, presenta caracter\u00edsticas singulares que no posee el aprendizaje tradicional, ni aquel que es mediado por el uso de instrumentos electr\u00f3nicos (e-learning). Las tecnolog\u00edas m\u00f3viles en general, y el tel\u00e9fono celular en particular, pueden ampliar y enriquecer las oportunidades educativas. Hay quienes utilizan los tel\u00e9fonos celulares para acceder a recursos pedag\u00f3gicos, usar juegos educativos, conectarse con otras personas o crear contenidos, tanto dentro como fuera del aula.\n\nLejos de ser una posibilidad te\u00f3rica, el uso de tel\u00e9fonos celulares es una realidad tangible: educandos ydocentes est\u00e1n utilizando hoy estos dispositivos para acceder a una gran variedad de contenidos educativos, conversar y compartir informaci\u00f3n con otros educandos, solicitar apoyo a compa\u00f1eros y profesores, y facilitar la comunicaci\u00f3n productiva. Sin embargo, el tel\u00e9fono celular no es y no ser\u00e1 nunca una panacea en el \u00e1mbito de la educaci\u00f3n, pese a que se trata de un instrumento poderoso, entre otros muchos, que a menudo no se tiene en cuenta y que puede brindar apoyo pedag\u00f3gico de modos insospechados hasta ahora. El desaf\u00edo entonces, es reconocer esta realidad y darle un sentido educativo.\n\nEn este curso esperamos que los participantes comprendan los alcances de la utilizaci\u00f3n de los tel\u00e9fonos celulares dentro y fuera del aula, conozcan diferentes aplicaciones que les permitir\u00e1n dise\u00f1ar y desarrollar una estrategia de trabajo en el aula que permita por una parte mejorar el aprendizaje y desarrollo de habilidades en los estudiantes, y por otra diversificar las pr\u00e1cticas pedag\u00f3gicas de los docentes, para conseguir una ense\u00f1anza m\u00e1s significativa y de mayor calidad al interior de los establecimientos educacionales.",

We visit the places where new ideas and practices were spawned, and we look at some of their unanticipated consequences.\nIn the three subsequent mini-courses, we seek answers to a second question: What are the best ways of lifting the performance of American schools to a higher level? To explore these questions, we look at ideas and proposals of those who want to save our schools\u2014be it by reforming the teaching profession, holding schools accountable, or giving families more school choices. In interviews with reform proponents and independent experts, we capture the intensity of the current debate. In the end, we do not find any silver bullets that can magically lift schools to a new level of performance, but we do pinpoint the pluses and minuses of many new approaches. These three subsequent mini-courses will launch later in the fall and continue into 2016.",

        "overview": "Students may choose to work at their own pace across all three subject areas, or to select individual content areas. Pretests will determine any learning deficits, which can then be mastered through self-paced learning modules. Not forgetting the importance of the human touch, this course is overseen by a trio of reading, writing, and mathematics professors who will be available to assist and encourage students along their journey to college readiness.\n\nThe reading portion of this course covers identifying, distinguishing, analyzing and inferring information from written English.\n\nThe writing portion of this course covers proper grammar, syntax and appropriate usage and mechanics of writing in English.\n\nThe math portion of this course covers whole numbers, integers, fractions, decimals, percents, inequalities and algebraic expressions.\n\n\n\nThis is not a traditional course, but a self-directed, self-study type of course; therefore in order to gain as much as possible of the knowledge and skills sought after, you need to be organized and manage your time well. There are no required assignments or deadlines for completing any activities (other than the timeframe of the entire course). However this course does include three distinct modules - reading, writing and math - and it is therefore equivalent to three separate short courses. It is up to you to decide which of the three modules' skills you want and/or need to focus mostly on (or all three) and create an appropriate schedule that fits your current personal, professional and family engagements. It is suggested that you devote at least ten hours per week to complete the learning activities required in each module. Make sure that you communicate with the instructor(s) or your classmates via the course email if you have any questions on any course materials or need assistance completing any activities. You can always communicate with the three available instructors leading the three course modules about any details pertaining to each of these three modules.",

What\u2019s this?\nABOUT THE COURSE \n\nNot too long ago, it was believed that anyone who graduated from a doctoral program was capable of teaching. In recent years, however, it has become apparent that teaching is not an intuitive behavior. In addition to content, teaching also involves a complex intellectual process, and to develop the \u201cart\u201d of teaching, professors require guidance and support. As the roles and responsibilities of university-level educators have evolved and expanded in recent years, the preparation of emerging university faculty leaders must focus on the development of the knowledge, skills, and strategies for teaching and learning in higher education. This short course is designed to introduce the strategies and exemplars of university teaching skills necessary to meet these new professional demands for teaching at a university level.  ",

En este se abordan dos cuestiones centrales para el contexto de las escuelas rurales. \nEn primer lugar, se propone caracterizar los rasgos de la planificaci\u00f3n y de las situaciones de ense\u00f1anza y de la evaluaci\u00f3n de los aprendizajes en escuelas rurales. \nEn segundo t\u00e9rmino, promover espacios reflexivos que permitan analizar procesos y producir instrumentos que colaboren con el trabajo en las aulas. \nLa observaci\u00f3n de situaciones de clases, o el an\u00e1lisis de casos presentados permitir\u00e1n leer en contexto todas aquellas acciones priorizadas en las aulas. \u00bfC\u00f3mo ense\u00f1amos en aulas heterog\u00e9neas? \u00bfC\u00f3mo evaluamos? Son preguntas que, a priori pueden parecer espec\u00edficas de escuelas en contextos rurales, pero que permiten profundizar en an\u00e1lisis extendidos para las aulas\u2026\nEl an\u00e1lisis cr\u00edtico y la reflexi\u00f3n sobre situaciones escolares y la elaboraci\u00f3n y reelaboraci\u00f3n de propuestas constituyen el foco de este curso.\n\nAl finalizar el curso ser\u00e1s capaz de:\n\n* Analizar los rasgos de la ense\u00f1anza y de la evaluaci\u00f3n en escuelas de contextos rurales.\n* Analizar la pertinencia de las decisiones que vinculan los contenidos seleccionados y las estrategias para ense\u00f1ar y evaluar.\n* Reconocer las distintas concepciones de ense\u00f1anza y de evaluaci\u00f3n y sus modos de concretarse en el aula.\n* Dise\u00f1ar propuestas de clases que promuevan aprendizajes en los estudiantes, utilizando estrategias y recursos que favorezcan el trabajo en aulas heterog\u00e9neas.\n* Dise\u00f1ar instrumentos de evaluaci\u00f3n que consideren la diversidad de estudiantes.",

        "overview": "If you're involved in education, it's likely that you've been hearing a lot about social and emotional learning (SEL) lately. It's seemingly everywhere these days. And while the goal of educating the \"whole child\" is not new, we know more about the impact of social and emotional skills on learning than ever before. We now know, for example, that social and emotional skills develop in direct connection to student academic learning1. In practice, this means that you are not forced to \"choose\" between SEL and academic instruction. Research has shown that students with SEL training \"scored 13 points higher academically than their peers 3.5 years later, had 6 percent better high school graduation rates, and could even reap lifelong monetary benefits for their healthy adult lifestyle.\"2 The big takeaway? We now know that the time that a teacher spends working on SEL skill development is not time taken away from academic instruction; it is time that is spent laying the foundation for academic achievement and lifelong health.\nOur team at the Friday Institute, along with a group of experts, researchers, and practitioners, developed this course with the goal of helping you build your own foundational understanding of how social and emotional learning (SEL) skills are essential to, and inseparable from, student learning. In doing so, you will build your own SEL skills, see examples of how others are teaching these skills, learn strategies to apply to your classroom, and share ideas with your colleagues in your school, your community, and around the globe. The course is designed to work in multiple ways: it complements existing district- and school-wide programs but can also be used in the absence of these programs to support educators in weaving SEL both explicitly and implicitly throughout academic instruction and the school day. The course is free for everyone and is intended to support self-directed adult learning. We want you to get out of it what you need.",

The essential questions for this unit are:\nWhat is the connection between SEL and learning?\nWhat are the foundations of SEL?\nWhat is the role of equity in teaching SEL?\nUnit 2: Self-Awareness\nThis unit focuses on the impact of self-awareness skills on educators' own lives as well as those of their students, emphasizing skills such as identifying emotions, having an accurate self-perception, recognizing strengths, possessing self-confidence, and demonstrating self-efficacy.

This week, we will identify ways to craft learning objectives for students and discuss strategies for incorporating those objectives into your instruction. \n\nWeek 4 \u2013 Assessment of Learning\nOnce we have outlined and implemented our learning objectives we must consider ways of assessing those learning objectives. We will discuss strategies for designing assessments that will align with your learning goals as well as how student mindset can influence their performance on these assessments.\n\nWeek 5 \u2013 Active Learning\nWe begin with a description of the benefits of active learning and how it fits into the overall learning cycle. Then, the module outlines two key features of active learning, teamwork and critical thinking, by showcasing several manifestations of active learning. \n\nWeek 6 \u2013 Inclusive Teaching\nWe will discuss inclusive teaching and many of the issues instructors can face when teaching classes composed of students of varying ethnicities and genders. We provide examples of teaching practices and language that can isolate certain student populations along with strategies to avoid these practices. \n\nWeek 7 \u2013 Lesson Planning\nThis week you will create an annotated lesson plan for a class you might teach in the future incorporating many of the principles covered in this course. \n\nWeek 8 \u2013 Conclusion\nIn the final week of the course, you\u2019ll provide feedback to your peers on their lesson plans and receive feedback on your lesson plan.",

In the resources this week, we explore what we mean by intelligence and how it can affect learning and educational success.\n\nWhat makes a good teacher?\n-In the third week of this course, we turn our attention from learning to teaching. In the resources this week we explore our images of \"good\" teachers and consider where these images come from.\n\nCan schools make a difference?\n-In this fourth week, we turn our attention from individual classrooms and the relationship between learning and teaching, and focus on schools as organisations\n\nWhy do governments fund education?\n-In this penultimate week of the course we expand our discussion still further and consider the role education plays in our societies.\n\nWhat future for education?\n-In this final week of the course, we return to the question that started it all off: what future for education?

Then, test your knowledge with the quizzes and be sure to comment on videos and post in the discussion forums to share your thoughts.\n\nActivities for Analyzing and Reflecting\n-In this module, we\u2019re moving from theory to practice, with videos that discuss drawing, sound, movement, writing, and game-based activities that build skills for analyzing and reflecting about art. Most videos touch upon a variety of methods, while the Take Action segments are in-depth demonstrations of specific activities. You\u2019ll get the most out of these videos by actually doing the activities yourself. We encourage you to snap a photo of something you\u2019ve made in response to a Take Action prompt, and then share it in the discussion forums.\n\nActivities for Creating, Imagining & Connecting\n-In this module, we\u2019ll stay active by covering activities that involve drawing, writing, discussion, sound, and movement. We\u2019ll also put on our designer hats, with a Take Action video that presents a cosmic design challenge. You\u2019ll have a chance to test your knowledge with the third and final quiz of the course. Finally, we want you to put all that you\u2019ve learned into practice by using one of the activities with family, friends, or students, and then reflecting on the experience in the discussion forums.\n\nAssessment Strategies\n-In this module, we shift the focus from activities to assessment. There are two videos; one that emphasizes self-assessment for you as the facilitator, and a second on assessing student work. Additionally, we have assigned two readings that support the video lectures, which you should complete before stating the final project.",

And how can you, as a student at university, achieve with integrity and honesty?\nThese are some of the important questions we\u2019ll explore over the four weeks of the course. As we do so, you will hear from the lead educator as well as the perspectives of students like you.\nSpecifically, each week contains videos, articles, activities and quizzes that will help you develop the knowledge and skills needed to be a successful and ethical learner. There will also be opportunities for you to discuss your ideas with other students on the course and learn from their experiences and points of view.\nBy the end of the course, we hope you\u2019ll come to understand the meaning of academic integrity and how to avoid academic dishonesty, misconduct and plagiarism but more importantly we hope you will also embrace the values associated with academic integrity as your own.\nAdditionally, and equally importantly, this course will help you develop study skills and academic writing skills needed to act in accordance with those values, and thus achieve with integrity.\nNo specific requirements.

We investigate how behavior management strategies can lead to emotional manipulation, as well as how students of color are disproportionately impacted by these policies. Knowing that SEL programs are often adopted with the aim of improving classroom management and reducing problem behaviors, we explore how this can instead be approached through humanizing structures of management that promote student agency.\n\nCulture, Context, and SEL\n-In this module we take up a second tension within SEL programming, the relative inattention to issues of culture and context in determining what SEL skills to promote. In situating SEL within larger cultural and structural contexts, we examine the need to consider issues of race, class, gender, sexuality, and culture in developing approaches to SEL.\n\nExamining \"Success\": Goals, Measurement, and Outcomes in SEL\n-\nIn this module, we consider a third tension in SEL programming - what success looks like, and how we measure it. We examine the different ways student outcomes have been measured, as well as the issues surrounding the assessment of soft skills such as social and emotional development.\n\nMoving Forward: A Critical Examination of the Self Competencies\n-In this module we move from articulating tensions within SEL to exploring ways forward. In this module, we focus on the two self-oriented competencies, self-awareness and self-management. In looking at more equity-oriented means of approaching self-awareness and self-management, we look at two examples in particular - mindfulness and testimonials.\n\nMoving Forward: A Critical Examination of the Social Competencies\n-In this module we continue our focus on equity-oriented ways of approaching SEL with a focus on the socially oriented competencies, social awareness and relationship building. In particular, we examine how critical witnessing and youth participatory action research (YPAR) can enhance traditional approaches to SEL.",

        "overview": "Teachers often face a number of complex challenges linked to the increasing language diversity experienced in many classrooms across Europe. Free movement across intra-European borders as well as increasing migration into Europe has made the language situation in Europe increasingly diverse over the last decades, and many teachers are struggling to find the most suitable way of approaching this situation.\nThe term \u201cteacher language awareness\u201d (TLA) refers to \u201cthe interface between what teachers know, or need to know, about language and their pedagogical practice\u201d (Andrews 2008). Although TLA is mostly referred to in the context of language teaching, it is also highly relevant to teachers of other subjects who are working in multi-lingual environments. While many teachers are already language-aware, many others are not conscious of the fact that linguistic diversity cannot only be perceived as a problem, but also as a very valuable pedagogical resource.\nThis course will encourage teachers of all age groups and from all subject disciplines to think more deeply about the importance of teacher language awareness and to better understand and utilise the linguistic diversity existing in their classroom. Besides, the course will provide teachers with different tools and resources to deliver curricular subjects in different languages and to plan lessons accordingly.",

The course is designed in response to the worrying disengagement of young people from STEM subjects in school, and their decreasing interest in related careers.\nThe course is structured into 8 modules which develop a learning path from the analysis of the reasons behind students\u2019 disaffection for STEM to the development and experimentations with innovative practices to overcome it.\nThe first 5 modules focus on motivating and engaging students in the STEM area through different approaches such as taking part in virtual visits to research centres and the use of virtual and remote labs and other innovative tools in the classroom. The last 3 modules explore career counselling aspects, providing guidance on how to inform students on STEM careers prospects and to support them in their choice. Modules are composed of video lectures of about 10 to 15 min., an activity to carry out, a section of optional materials that you can counsult to deepen your knowledge and a quiz to evaluate what you have learnt at the end of each module.",

The PhD is an emotional journey as much as it is an intellectual one.\nWhat kinds of emotions does the research degree process provoke? What strategies can help students deal with the emotional highs and lows? How can academic advisors, family and friends help research students cope with these stresses - and celebrate the successes?\nThis course is primarily designed for masters, PhD, and research students and the academics who are tasked with helping them, but you may also be a family member or friend of a PhD student who is seeking to better understand what your loved one is going through.\nBy directly addressing the emotional issues, and by helping us see the connections between emotional resilience and success, this course aims to help us all create a more supportive academic environment, where students can do their best research work.

We examine these factors and start to look at the causes.\n \nWeek Two: A quick history of the doctorate\nTo better understand how and research degree study can be so difficult we will take a brief tour back to the late middle ages and the birth of the university - as a place and an idea.\n \nWeek Three: Confidence\nWe take a look at confidence, in particular why some students have very little. We\u2019ll explore the imposter syndrome and how we might counter it and then have a look at the risks of over confidence.\n \nWeek Four: Frustration\nThis week we look at frustration. Research can be very frustrating, but writing is perhaps the site of most of the frustration that students feel. We explore the nature of this frustration and how supervisors can make it better - or worse.\n \n\nLoneliness and isolation seems to be a common problem for research students - but how does it happen? We look at the difference between social isolation and intellectual isolation. We tackle the difficult problem of how much help a supervisor should really give a student.\n \n\nResearch students are high achievers who often have an intense fear of failure. We look at two fears in particular - fear of writing and fear of speaking in public.\n \n\nGood researchers are curious creatures! Curiosity is crucial to research, but what happens when curiosity gets out of control? This week we focus on the literature review as a site where curiosity can get out of control.\n \n\nConfusion is an inevitable part of the research degree process - but do research students get confused about the same sorts of  things?\n \n\nA research degree usually involves a big project that takes place over an extended period of time. It\u2019s inevitable that some students will get bored. But boredom is much more interesting than you might think!\n \n\nDo researchers always love their work? What about love for your supervisor - is that appropriate? If you truly love your discipline, how should you behave as a researcher? This week we look at Love - and it\u2019s complicated.",

        "overview": "All over the world, including India, there is an aspiration that every student should be actively engaged in their learning. Achieving this aspiration demands highly skilled teachers and quality teacher education. \n \nThis course introduces teacher educators to Open Educational Resources \u2013 freely available learning materials that can be adapted for use in particular contexts.  The course explores how you can use OER in the design and delivery of your teacher education programmes to help you bring about the transformation of classroom teaching and learning.   Throughout the course there will be a particular focus on the OER generated by TESS- India. These innovative multi-lingual text and video OER (www.tess-india.edu.in) aim to support teachers in developing participatory approaches through modelling links between theory and practice in classroom activities.   You will explore the values and pedagogy underpinning teacher education OER from TESS-India and other repositories and learn how you can adapt and incorporate these OER for your own contexts and students. \n \nThrough participation in the course you will develop skills in locating, adapting and producing OER. Collaboration and the co-creation of OER will be key themes; you will be introduced to ways of working and open practices that you will be able to take forward into your professional working.  Through the course you may also form and strengthen your professional support network of fellow teacher educators. \n \nThe course is designed primarily for teacher educators working in the Indian context in both pre-service and in-service education with primary and secondary school teachers in formal and informal programmes. However it has significant application for teacher educators globally. ",

This highly interactive course will introduce students to the fundamental concepts of computer science. The course will be structured to encourage students to think computationally and enjoy problem solving. New York City\u2019s companies, museums, art and architecture will be used as examples to emphasize the ubiquitous role of computing and programming concepts in the world around us.\nThe course will delve into object- oriented problem solving and design using the Java  programming language.  Students will have access to practice problems that will help them learn to program without spending hours on finding and fixing syntax errors.  These will include online multiple-choice questions in the style of those on the AP exam, mixed-up code that the user drags into the correct order, fill in the blank code and audio tours of the code.\nTopics include problem solving,  programming design strategies and  data structures, algorithms, role of computation in real-world applications like smart phones, google glass and robots. This material may be used for self-study and as a preview by students and teachers considering the September 2015 offering of the course. Video lectures for this course will be available in May 2015.  Ancillary material including labs will be added over the Summer of 2015. All of the course will be available September 1, 2015",

        "syllabus": "Introduction: Teaching and Learning Science\n-Welcome to your first week of Teaching Science at University! In this first module we will give you an overview of what you will learn during our 5-week course and show you what you can achieve as an excellent lecturer or teaching assistant at your university! In the first lesson our focus is on evidence-based teaching. We will show you how you can base your lectures, lab classes, and courses on science education research. You will learn about main principles of visible learning and mind frames which will help you to embrace these principles. Then we will adapt learning theories to science teaching, starting with behaviorism up to cognitivism, constructivism, and neurodidactics. Interviews with a Professor in Animal Behaviour and a Professor in Neuroscience give further insight in the way we learn. At the end of the first week, you should be able to implement and reflect upon one evidence-based teaching strategy in your own teaching. Have fun!\n\nConceptual Change\n-Welcome to your second week of Teaching Science at University. Understanding scientific concepts is the core of learning science, but often our pre-instructional conceptions act as barriers to reach an appropriate understanding. In this module we will show how to guide students from their everyday conceptions to scientific ones. You will learn how to use your students\u2019 pre-conceptions not as obstacles but as starting points for teaching science. We will show you some methods for a quick assessment of your students\u2019 conceptions. We look at strategies how we can change our students\u2019 conceptions and how we can help your students to change their ideas. Finally we consider how you as a teacher can foster student engagement in class. At the end of the second week you should be able to address the pre- instructional conceptions of your students in your teaching.\n\nTeaching with analogies\n-Welcome to the third week of Teaching Science at University! In this week we would like to show how invisible concepts become visible. In everyday life we learn so many things by comparing and contrasting. From research we know that the use of analogies and metaphors are important features in the scientific endeavor, and their use in teaching science seems a natural extension. We raise the question whether analogies are just excellent communication tools or if they can generate new knowledge. What do the majority of students really understand when analogies are used to explain abstract and difficult ideas such as molecular structures, diffusion, and plate tectonics? We show that It is important to consider students\u2019 personal constructions since no student enters the lecture hall as \u201ctabula rasa.\u201d Science classrooms are common settings in which analogies are used to enhance concept learning; therefore, improving the way analogies are used in science education has important teaching and learning consequences. At the end of the third week you should be able to choose good analogies for teaching science and implement them fruitfully.\n\n(Re-)Frame your science teaching\n-Welcome to the fourth week of Teaching Science at University! In this week we want to show you how we can frame our science teaching to increase interest, motivation, and understanding of the students. In the first lesson we ask how the framing of science teaching can help students see the relevance of science for society. We look at problems from everyday life and their potential to foster students understanding of science. Activating our students is one key to reducing failure rates in our classrooms. We look how to design a new course by setting the goals our students have to achieve and how to foster learning when supervising a thesis. Finally we look how to communicate risk and uncertainty in an appropriate way to foster understanding. At the end of this week you should be able to frame your science teaching to make it relevant for your students.\n\nTeaching science in a lab or field\n-Welcome to the fifth week of Teaching Science at University! In this week we want to show you how we can improve students\u2019 learning in a lab or in the field. In the first lesson we show you how to design a lab class, then we focus on delivering a lab class. We show you how you can use design principles (known as \u201cgestalt principles\u201d) to present experiments in a manner which is easy for your students to understand. Then we look at a model on students\u2019 competences on experimentation that you can use to track the development of your students\u2019 conceptual development. From research we know that students often hold inadequate conceptions about the nature of science and the scientific endeavor. We show you how you can address these conceptions to enable your students to understand the meaning of experiments, models, and theories in science. Finally we focus on the role of models in science education. We look at a model for model competence you can use to analyse where your students stand and to train different dimensions of dealing with models. At the end of this week you should be able to design a lab class that improves the inquiry skills of your students.",

You will learn how to conduct learning analytics in face-to-face, hands-on, unbounded, and analog learning settings such as classrooms and labs. You will learn to capture, process, and fuse natural rich modalities of communication, such as speech, writing, and nonverbal interaction (e.g., movements, gestures, facial expressions, gaze, biometrics, etc.) during real learning activities.\nMultimodal learning analytics enable you to understand and optimize learning in real-world environments that do not necessarily use computers during the learning process.\nThe course content is a gentle introduction to this new approach to learning analytics: its promises, its challenges, its tools and methodologies. To follow the same spirit of multimodal learning analytics, this course will include hands-on learning experiences analyzing different types of signals captured from real environments.",

        "overview": "This course will provide graduate students and post-doctoral fellows in the STEM disciplines (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) who are planning college and university faculty careers with an introduction to evidence-based teaching practices. Participants will learn about effective teaching strategies and the research that supports them, and they will apply what they learn to the design of lessons and assignments they can use in future teaching opportunities. Those who complete the course will be more informed and confident teachers, equipped for greater success in the undergraduate classroom.   \nThe course will draw on the expertise of experienced STEM faculty, educational researchers, and staff from university teaching centers, many of them affiliated with the Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching, and Learning (CIRTL), a network of 21 research universities collaborating in the preparation of STEM graduate students and post-docs as future faculty members. The eight-week course will be highly interactive, with many opportunities for peer-to-peer learning. Learning communities are at the heart of CIRTL\u2019s activities, and this open, online course is intended to foster a large, healthy learning community of those interested in undergraduate STEM teaching--including current STEM faculty.\n\"An Introduction to Evidence-Based Undergraduate STEM Teaching\" has been developed by faculty, staff, and students at Vanderbilt University, Michigan State University, Boston University, the , and the . The course is based on work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1347605.",

We\u2019ll consider the research supporting these principles and examples of how STEM faculty put them into practice.\n\nWeek 2 \u2013 Principles of Learning, Part 2\nThis week we continue our exploration of learning principles that apply in all teaching contexts.  These include, effective ways of providing feedback to students and student motivations for learning. We\u2019ll consider the research supporting these principles and examples of how STEM faculty put them into practice.\n\nWeek 3 \u2013 Learning Objectives\nDesigning an effective learning experience for students means beginning with the end in mind. In this week, we will identify ways to craft meaningful learning objectives for one\u2019s students and discuss strategies for incorporating those objectives in your instruction.\n\nWeek 4 \u2013 Assessment of Learning\nOnce we have outlined and implemented our learning objectives we must consider the most effective way of assessing those learning objectives.  This week we will discuss strategies for designing assessments that will align with your learning goals as well as how student mindset can influence their performance on these assessments.\n\n\nThe module begins with a description of the benefits of active learning and how it fits into the overall learning cycle. Then, the module outlines two key features of active learning, teamwork and critical thinking, by showcasing several manifestations of active learning.\n\n\nThis week we will discuss the importance of inclusive teaching and many of the issues instructors can face when teaching classes composed of students of varying ethnicities and genders.  We provide you with examples of teaching practices and language that can isolate certain student populations along with strategies to avoid these practices.\n\n\nThis week you will create an annotated lesson plan for a class you might teach in the future incorporating many of the principles covered in this course.\n\n\nDuring the final week of the course, you'll provide feedback to your peers on their draft lesson plans and, in turn, receive feedback on your lesson plan.",

Finally, you will share your portfolio with other learners to demonstrate the skills you have learned and receive feedback, and you will get the chance to learn from others as you give them feedback on their portfolios. After you complete this course, you will have the skills you need to effectively create your own lesson plans, practice exercises and assessments needed to teach grammar to intermediate-level students.\n\nLearners in this course must be able to create a video using a webcam, video camera, or smart phone and upload the video files or share the video as a link.",

It should be specific and follow the specific requirements given.\n\nMake a Video of Your Teaching\n-You should have your lesson plan mostly planned by now and have a good idea of what your lesson will include. This week, create a video of yourself introducing your grammar point to your students. Give yourself a lot of time to do this because working with technology often takes more time than you expect.\n\nCreate Practice Activities\n-Now, you will make the two practice activities for your students to practice the grammar. In addition to the practice activities, you need to create handouts of some type to go with each one.\n\nCreate Assessments\n-Now, you'll make the assessments for your portfolio. The first one will be an informal assessment. The second one will be a formal assessment and will include an answer key or rubric.\n\nSubmit the Portfolio\n-This week, you will finish any work on the portfolio that you haven't finished yet. Then you'll submit all of the pieces of it for feedback from other learners. You'll also give feedback to three others.",

You should have basic knowledge of intermediate grammar and teaching methodology in order to complete this course. In this course, you will create a portfolio including all of the following for one specific intermediate grammar point: a lesson plan for the grammar point, a video of yourself introducing the grammar point, two related practice exercises or activities with handouts, an informal assessment, and a formal assessment with answer key. To do this, you will put into practice all of the skills that you have learned in the previous three courses. Finally, you will share your portfolio with other learners to demonstrate the skills you have learned and receive feedback, and you will get the chance to learn from others as you give them feedback on their portfolios. After you complete this course, you will have the skills you need to effectively create your own lesson plans, practice exercises and assessments needed to teach grammar to intermediate-level students.\n\nLearners in this course must be able to create a video using a webcam, video camera, or smart phone and upload the video files or share the video as a link.",

        "overview": "The Catholic identity of schools today is being challenged by processes of pluralisation and secularisation. While school communities used to be considered more or less homogeneous, nowadays schools are characterised by increasing diversity and a diminishing interest in the Catholic faith tradition, among students as well as teachers.\n\nHow can schools today maintain and strengthen their Catholic identity, while simultaneously remaining open to diversity and otherness? How can the Catholic faith tradition stay relevant for young people today in a way that takes their individuality into account?\n\nThe model of the Catholic Dialogue School, developed at the Catholic University of Leuven, provides a theological framework and a pedagogical strategy for schools that want to enhance their Catholic identity.\n\nOn the one hand, it supports principals and teachers in \u2018translating\u2019 Catholic teachings so that they become more life-giving and inspiring for students. On the other hand, it encourages schools to enter into dialogue with other traditions and ideologies that are present at school and in society. After all, it is through this dialogue that one\u2019s own identity can be strengthened and deepened in a mutually enriching process.\n\nIn the words of Pope Francis:\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough five extensive modules of this MOOC, you will become acquainted with a new vocabulary and theological framework regarding Catholic school identity. You will learn, in an active way, about several quantitative instruments to assess the Catholic identity of your school - alongside practical theological instruments to strengthen and enhance it.",

When we want to describe the identity of a Catholic school today \u2013 with the aim of enhancing its future identity \u2013 we first look at how the individuals within the school relate to faith.\nInstitutional Identity\nIn this section, we turn from studying how individuals relate to religious content, to how they see their school relating to the Catholic faith tradition \u2013 that is, we move from personal perspectives regarding religious belief to how those same individuals perceive the identity of the school itself. You will learn how to assess Catholic identity and will be invited to think about how to strengthen it.\nProfessional Identity\nAll components are supported by knowledge clips, lectures, exercises, examples, online questionnaires, discussion fora, practical issues, case studies, etc.",

Then, we highlight SEL as one means of developing social emotional well-being, positioning it in relation to other approaches, while highlighting our course\u2019s focus on SEL programs and theories.\n\nThe Field of SEL: Purposes and Origins\n-In this section of the course, we trace the origins of the field of SEL, identifying how a perceived need for greater attention to children\u2019s social and emotional development in schools grew in part from the popularization of theories of multiple intelligence and emotional intelligence in the mid to late 1990s. We identify other educational theories that support this work before attending to a discussion of what SEL is, identified primarily through its goals, purposes, and aims.\n\nSEL Program Formats and Characteristics of Effective Programs\n-In this section of the course, we attend to the ways in which school-based SEL programs differ with regard to scope, focus, audience and mode of infusion. Additionally, we take up general considerations of the characteristics of effective programs and practices with the intent of providing participants the tools necessary to evaluate specific SEL programs.\n\nSEL Across the Developmental Spectrum: Early Childhood and Elementary\n-The focus in this section of the course is on SEL programs in early childhood education and in elementary schools. We aim to provide a broad overview of programs on the market, and considerations specific to \u201cdoing SEL\u201d with young children. Additionally, we aim to challenge participants to evaluate the usefulness of various programs for their own purposes with respect to the criteria and considerations identified in Week 3.\n\nSEL Across the Developmental Spectrum: Middle and High School\n-The focus in this section of the course is on SEL programs in middle and high school contexts. We aim to provide a broad overview of programs on the market, considerations specific to \u201cdoing SEL\u201d with older students, and an exploration of why SEL is particularly important at this stage in development. Additionally, we will highlight YPAR as one means of critically attending to principles of SEL as a preview of the focus of Course B. Finally, we aim to challenge participants to evaluate the usefulness of various programs for their own purposes with respect to the criteria and considerations identified in Week 2.",

The goal of BlendKit: Becoming a Blended Learning Designer is to provide facilitated assistance to faculty members and instructional designers in developing and designing blended courses through (1) a consideration of key issues related to blended learning and (2) practical step-by-step guidance in producing materials for a blended course (e.g., developing design documents, creating content pages, and receiving peer review feedback at one's own institution).\nHistory\nA Next Generation Learning Challenges (NGLC) grant in 2011 leveraged the University of Central Florida\u2019s expertise to create the Blended Learning Toolkit as a free, open resource for educational institutions interested in developing or expanding their blended learning initiatives. The American Association of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU), UCF\u2019s grant partner, agreed to use its membership to distribute the toolkit and support new course models. The BlendKit course emerged from the grant to assist educators in designing blended courses and has supported three open, online cohorts since 2012.",

You will have the opportunity to watch an interview with Jay McTighe, who co-wrote Understanding by Design, a leading design process for educators.\n\nWeek 3: Integrating technology for innovating instruction\nThe third module will address the need to integrate technology into our projects. In well-designed projects, digital tools can be powerful devices for student-centered learning. Project-based learning can support an inclusive environment for learners. Technology can play an important role in supporting an equitable learning experience.\n\n\nThe fourth module examines the use of technology tools in formative assessment to better understand the thinking of our students.

        "overview": "Descripci\u00f3n de curso\nLa ECOE es una prueba de evaluaci\u00f3n puesta en marcha recientemente en nuestra Facultad y para la que los estudiantes del Grado en Medicina reclaman formaci\u00f3n espec\u00edfica. En esencia se trata de una evaluaci\u00f3n con casos cl\u00ednicos estandarizados en la que los estudiantes deben mostrar su competencia pr\u00e1ctica en \u00e1reas como anamnesis, exploraci\u00f3n cl\u00ednica o habilidades de comunicaci\u00f3n, entre otras. Se realiza en un ambiente cl\u00ednico lo m\u00e1s cercano posible al real, usando pacientes simulados que representan fielmente los m\u00e1s diversos casos de la pr\u00e1ctica cl\u00ednica. Se trata pues de evaluar la formaci\u00f3n pr\u00e1ctica de los estudiantes de una manera objetiva y estructurada. Durante las pruebas ECOE que hemos realizado en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os, cuatro desde 2013, nuestros estudiantes han solicitado siempre m\u00e1s formaci\u00f3n sobre esta nueva modalidad de evaluaci\u00f3n de sus conocimientos pr\u00e1cticos. Es por ello que consideramos de gran importancia la producci\u00f3n de un MOOC sobre este tema. De esta manera, conseguiremos llegar a todos los estudiantes con un medio online que les permitir\u00e1 mejorar su formaci\u00f3n a su propio ritmo.",

        "syllabus": "Being a Teacher: A Professional Privilege\n-This first week gives an introduction to the course and asks what it is to be a teacher. This is a chance for you to reflect on you own identity and aspirations as a teacher and gain an informed understanding of the world, or worlds, of childhood. You will build on and extend your existing knowledge as a teacher. We will discuss the ways in which teaching can be defined as a profession and what it means to be a professional teacher.\n\nThinking About Learning\n-The videos in this week are all related to the theme of children and young people\u2019s learning. The emphasis is on thinking \u2018skills\u2019 \u2013 learning how to think effectively and creatively. We ask how you as a teacher ensure that students are thinking while they are in your classroom. You will write an essay which brings together the various strands of your learning. This is for your own professional development, but it will also help you to consider what the implications are for teaching and learning in your own classroom.\n\nHow Good is My Classroom?\n-This week is focused on the classroom and asks you to consider the question \u2018How good is my classroom?\u2019 It asks you to revisit, replay, and bring together the many ingredients that make a classroom a stimulating place for learning and an enjoyable and engaging place for teaching. We come back to the importance of assessment for learning. As Dylan Wiliam says, \u2018assessment is minute by minute in the classroom\u2019, not simply something that happens at the end of the course.\n\nContinuing to Learn in a Changing World\n-This week focuses on ways that we can help children to live and learn in a world of change. We will consider the importance of cultivating creativity and acknowledging multiple types of intelligence. We will also look at learning that takes place informally outside of school. We will identify key features of excellent practice in schools and look at the benefits of professional development. This is the final week of this course. If you have stayed with us to the end, congratulations! This may be an ending but it is also a beginning as you move on to the next course.",

The new standards specifically describe the importance of students understanding the reasoning of others and engaging in meaningful conversations using evidence for claims. Yet this type of student-to-student interaction tends to be rare in classrooms. Common classroom teaching activities such as whole class discussions, jigsaws, and think-pair-shares can have the appearance of constructive interactions, but they often do not provide adequate opportunities for all students to engage in back-and-forth dialog. This course looks closely at student-to-student conversations and addresses ways to improve students' abilities to engage in the types of interactions described in the new standards.\nThis course consists of four main sessions with three weeks between each session in order to provide extra time for application and reflection. The learning in this course relies heavily on participant contributions and comments, especially in the team collaboration setting. Participants will be expected to complete both team and individual assignments for all sessions. The sessions and assignments are designed for participants who teach or have access to classrooms in which they can gather samples of students\u2019 conversation during lessons. Finally, we include resources and tasks for instructional coaches and others who support teachers and build school-wide capacity.",

To learn more about the computation and computing concepts that underlie those technologies? We'll be using a problem-based approach to explore interesting ways to teach concepts of networks and the internet, data and analysis, and even algorithms and data representation. Finally, we'll evaluate, critique and improve a TedED activity around the ethical choices facing designers of self-driving cars.\n\nFreedom of Speech\n-Have you ever thoughts of technology as a support or amplification of free speech? No need to get a news program or journalist to \"get your story out there\" when you can tweet! But not everyone on the planet has equal access to the internet or apps that enable people to share their viewpoints. We'll look at a range of technologies related (in some way!) to this including: VPN, cell phone batteries, and internet connectivity at the global scale.\n\nLife Made Easy\n-How has technology made your life easier? One thing I love is that travel, including traveling outside of my home country has gotten a LOT easier -- just because I can use my smartphone to find information and directions when I am abroad! But there's other ways global, ubiquitous access to the internet and cheap computational devices is changing our lives. Super hot things right now are \"the Internet of Things\" -- and specifically self-driving cars. Let's learn more about them!\n\nKeeping your Information Secure\n-As our individual data generation and collection grows, so does the collective amount of data stored in the world. Controlling access and maintaining the privacy of our data -- especially as we use our myriad of devices in places far outside our own homes over wireless connections -- is critical. We'll also toss in here the concept of having a secure form of money -- bitcoin!\n\nImpacts of Computing & Pedagogy",

Education about online safety should surely begin at home, but it is by no means the sole responsibility of parents and caretakers: teachers should also be able to provide their pupils and students with all the necessary tools to face the online world in an empowered and responsible manner. It goes without saying that industry and other stakeholders (such as government and policymakers) also have a role to play.\nWhen it comes to online issues and trends, \u2018fake news\u2019 has unfortunately taken centre stage in 2017 \u2013 for this very reason, one of the main objectives of this online course is to promote media literacy and stress the importance of critical thinking skills, with which all children and young people should be equipped from the very start. It is only through this means that they will be able to distinguish reliable sources of information from misinformation. With multiple initiatives being undertaken at national level to educate youngsters about the dangers of fake news (for example, Le Monde journalists in France and their British counterparts from the BBC in the UK have developed resources which can be used in schools), we believe schools and teachers can play a crucial role in building young people\u2019s resilience to fake news.",

El aprendizaje basado en proyectos, le proporciona a los estudiantes las competencias para el \u00e9xito acad\u00e9mico, profesional y personal, y prepara a los j\u00f3venes para enfrentar los desaf\u00edos del futuro laboral y particular. Los proyectos cient\u00edficos escolares se utilizan para el desarrollo de competencias cient\u00edficas por parte de los alumnos y como una estrategia din\u00e1mica de ense\u00f1anza-aprendizaje de la ciencia. Sin embargo, la formaci\u00f3n de profesores no necesariamente apunta a desarrollar competencias para formular o guiar una investigaci\u00f3n cient\u00edfica, por lo que muchos docentes a pesar de tener un dominio de su disciplina, se ven limitados por no contar con las habilidades suficientes de investigaci\u00f3n cient\u00edfica.

But how is that possible? Why are we glued to games? Can we design that kind of gameful experiences in non-game contexts to make them more engaging?\nAnd the most important question: How to do so?\nLearning Outcomes\nIn this course you'll learn the basics of Gamification with a highly practical approach.

Do you toss and turn at night wondering if your materials have been effective and useful for your learners? Enroll in this short course to pick up some tips on using a range of instructional methods to engage your adult learners and make their learning relevant and meaningful.\nAs a needs-based course, we will first determine the type of program you are currently or will be facilitating, and then recommend a range of instructional methods that are relevant to your learners and the learning outcomes for the program.\nWith the help of video resources, short notes, formative quizzes, and forum discussions, you will engage with the learning materials both individually and with a community of like-minded practitioners. Hear from experts how they adapt these instructional methods for their own facilitation purposes, and start or join conversations to discuss these methods at greater length and depth.\nThis course is for both new and experienced trainers.\nAs the course design is based on your needs as a trainer, there is no need for you to work through everything, only what you deem relevant to you.

While this MOOC-Ed will help prepare you to teach BJC, the online course alone does not meet the requirements to become a College Board certified AP teacher; attending a summer BJC Professional Development workshop is required for that certification. Information about those workshops is available at https://bjc.berkeley.edu/summer-pd. Ideally, BJC teachers will be able to both attend a BJC Institute and use this MOOC-Ed to further their preparation.\nMuch of this MOOC-Ed is built around short videos of pairs of students working together to solve BJC curriculum programming challenges. These videos demonstrate students' \u2014 often very clever \u2014 problem solving, while also highlighting some common mistakes your students may make, misconceptions they may have, and misdirections they may take. These student videos serve several important purposes in this course for teachers, including to:\nProvide you with a concrete sense of what BJClooks like in practice;",

Expert teacher panels discuss strategies for facilitating both the programming labs and teaching students about the global impact of computing through the social implications labs and Computing in the News activities.\nSession 2: Introducing the Snap! Programming Language\nIn this session, you will explore coding concepts central to all programming languages and begin to learn about the Snap! programming language and environment, from learning how to set up an account to experimenting by revising or extending a starting script. As a self-directed learning experience, this session should be approached differently by those who are new to computer programming, those who have programming experience but are new to the Snap! language, and those who already know Snap!",

In classrooms that are Emotionally Supportive children and adults are comfortable with one another and excited about learning. They look forward to spending time together and know that, even when times are tough, there will be someone there to help them.\nWhat do you need to know to be a really effective early childhood teacher? Teachers need many types of knowledge \u2013 knowledge about children\u2019s development, about the content they\u2019re teaching, about effective teaching practices, about the needs and abilities of the children in their classrooms, and about themselves.

Students may be able to live perfectly fulfilled and happy lives unaware of what may seem like trivial historical information, but they cannot thrive in today's information society without the ability to read, write, and think at the highest levels. History, taught well, can help students develop those skills. History can also help students understand the world in which they live and how they fit into that world.\n\nThis class will lead secondary teachers through an exploration of the importance of studying history and what it means to think historically. Teachers who take the class will learn how to explain the historical process of questioning and analytical thinking, creating rigorous lesson plans that help students develop the skills that will serve them well in any academic discipline.",

At the end of the course teachers will be asked to create an action plan for use in their classrooms.",

If the print textbook is replaced by an e-book, do the social relations of knowledge and learning necessarily change at all or for the better?

        "syllabus": "Module 1: Course Orientation + Ubiquitous Learning\n-We begin this module with an introduction to the idea of an \"e-learning ecology\" and the notion of \"affordance.\" We use this idea to map the range of innovative activities that we may be able to use in e-learning environments \u2013 not that we necessarily do. Many e-learning environments simply reproduce the worst of old, didactic pedagogies. We then go on to explore the notion of \"ubiquitous learning,\" the first of seven \"affordances\" in computer-mediated educational applications and environments that we examine in this course.\n\nModule 2: Active Knowledge Making + Multimodal Meaning\n-This module examines two more e-learning affordances: \"active knowledge making,\" or the right and responsibility of learners to take a degree of control over their own knowledge making; and \"multimodal meaning-making,\" or the tools learners now have at hand to support their thinking and to represent the knowledge they have gained \u2013 including, for instance, text, image, diagram, animation, simulation, dataset, video, audio, or embedded web media.\n\nModule 3: Recursive Feedback + Collaborative Intelligence\n-Two further e-learning affordances are explored in this module: \"recursive feedback,\" or the rapid and repeatable cycles of feedback or formative assessment now available, including machine feedback and machine-mediated human feedback; and the \"collaborative intelligence\" fostered by the very social nature of Web 2.0 and contemporary e-learning environments.\n\nModule 4: Metacogniton + Differentiated Learning\n-We come now to the last two of our seven e-learning affordances: \"metacognition,\" or the process of thinking about thinking \u2013 a second order, more abstract, theoretical, and generalizable way of thinking; and \"differentiated learning,\" addressing learners' different needs and interests. Together, these seven affordances become a tool with which to evaluate the scope of an e-learning technology and its application.",

It's for students, teachers, professors, researchers, administrators, policy makers, business leaders, job counselors and recruiters, parents, and lifelong learners around the globe.  The full,  whimsical name of the class is: \u201cThe History and Future of (Mostly) Higher Education: Or, How We Can Unlearn Our Old Patterns and Relearn for a Happier, More Productive, Ethical, and Socially-Engaged Future.\u201d  That subtitle is inspired by Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen who has said that \"all education is vocational\" in the sense that it is our job, as educators, to help train people for the vocation of leading better lives. \nAre we fulfilling that educational objective, from kindergarten to professional school?  Or are we training students with the methods, philosophy, and metrics designed for the Fordist era of the Model T?  Since 1993, when scientists made the Internet widely available, our lives, our work, our occupations, our culture, and our entertainments have changed tremendously.  Far too little has changed inside our educational institutions, in the US and internationally, to prepare us for the demands, problems, restrictions, obstacles,  responsibilities, and possibilities of living in the world we inhabit outside of school.  This course addresses one key question:  How can we all, together, work to redesign higher education for our future... not for someone else\u2019s past?",

Why?  What happens when students are in charge?  What happens when education begins at a place where no one (not even the instructor) knows the answer in advance? What if the actual learning cannot be tested or assessed by the usual methods of higher education? What if learning is also about trying to improve the status quo?  This week we will look at diverse histories and theories of education and learning.",

Alors ce cours est fait pour vous ! Quelle que soit la mati\u00e8re que vous enseignez d\u2019habitude, vos \u00e9l\u00e8ves et vous-m\u00eames \u00eates cern\u00e9s par les nouvelles technologies. Il suffit d\u2019observer Facebook, Google ou Youtube pour comprendre que ce sont les jeunes qui sont souvent \u00e0 l\u2019origine de ces bouleversements technologiques : leur cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 n\u2019a jamais eu autant d\u2019influence qu\u2019aujourd\u2019hui. Quant aux embauches de demain, la plupart se feront dans les technologies de l\u2019information (TI), avec un impact certain sur tous les autres secteurs, de l\u2019agriculture au tourisme en passant par les t\u00e9l\u00e9coms et les services financiers.\nAvec ce cours, vous aurez tous les outils en main pour encourager les jeunes d\u2019aujourd\u2019hui \u00e0 devenir les acteurs du num\u00e9rique de demain. Ce cours s\u2019appuie sur le fameux syst\u00e8me Scratch, une plateforme ludique qui facilite l\u2019apprentissage continu de la programmation et qui passionne d\u00e9j\u00e0 des millions d\u2019enfants \u00e0 travers le monde en faisant appel \u00e0 leur cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9. Vous serez surpris par la vitesse \u00e0 laquelle les petits sont capables de s&#039;approprier les fruits de ce fantastique outil p\u00e9dagogique, et m\u00eame si vous n\u2019avez jamais programm\u00e9 la moindre ligne de code de votre vie, aucun souci ! Ce cours vous expliquera tout, \u00e9tape par \u00e9tape !\nCe cours s\u2019inscrit dans le cadre de l\u2019initiative Africa Code Week, un puissant vecteur d\u2019alphab\u00e9tisation num\u00e9rique visant \u00e0 mettre entre les mains des jeunes Africains les outils et comp\u00e9tences dont ils ont besoin pour r\u00e9ussir au 21\u00e8me si\u00e8cle et contribuer activement \u00e0 l\u2019essor \u00e9conomique de l\u2019Afrique. Il vous est propos\u00e9 en parall\u00e8le des centaines d\u2019ateliers pr\u00e9sentiels organis\u00e9s un peu partout en Afrique en pr\u00e9paration des activit\u00e9s d\u2019octobre. Ainsi, que vous vous trouviez en Afrique ou ailleurs, vous pouvez vous aussi apprendre \u00e0 ma\u00eetriser l\u2019un des outils de programmation les plus simples et les plus amusants qui soient !\nNous avons le plaisir de vous offrir ce cours \u00e9galement dans le cadre de l\u2019EU Code Week 2015. Alors, o\u00f9 que vous vous trouviez, accompagnez-nous dans le monde du code!",

        "syllabus": "Apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o do curso Ensino H\u00edbrido\n-Muitos de voc\u00eas procuraram esse curso porque, certamente, fazem parte de um grupo de educadores que pretende inovar na educa\u00e7\u00e3o. Acima de tudo, fazem parte de um grupo que acredita que muito do que existe precisa ser mantido, mas muito precisa ser modificado para que os estudantes aprendam mais e melhor. Conhecer diferentes experi\u00eancias de uso integrado das tecnologias digitais e buscar inspira\u00e7\u00e3o para refletir sobre sua pr\u00e1tica \u00e9 o objetivo desse curso. O curso n\u00e3o tem a inten\u00e7\u00e3o, portanto, de apresentar solu\u00e7\u00f5es prontas, n\u00e3o h\u00e1 certo ou errado, mas h\u00e1 uma possibilidade de compartilhar com os pares experi\u00eancias e conhecimentos, com a estrutura do curso promovendo situa\u00e7\u00f5es para que esse movimento aconte\u00e7a. Por ser um curso auto-instrucional, sem tutoria, a forma\u00e7\u00e3o acontece entre pares e, dessa forma, a participa\u00e7\u00e3o nos f\u00f3runs \u00e9 essencial. Junte-se ao grupo e aproveite o curso!\n\nIntrodu\u00e7\u00e3o ao Ensino H\u00edbrido e reflex\u00f5es iniciais\n-Sabemos que o ensino considerado \u201ctradicional\u201d, mesmo nas melhores escolas, n\u00e3o d\u00e1 mais conta, sozinho, das necessidades do aluno de hoje, como deu conta no passado. Um caminho poss\u00edvel \u00e9 reunir o que h\u00e1 de melhor no ensino considerado \u201ctradicional\u201d com as vantagens do ensino online, misturando o melhor dos dois mundos! \u00c9 sobre isso que iremos refletir nesta aula, vamos l\u00e1?\n\nO papel do professor no Ensino H\u00edbrido\n-A postura do professor com o uso personalizado das tecnologias digitais n\u00e3o \u00e9 a mesma que em uma aula tradicional. Aqui, quem deve estar no centro do processo de ensino e aprendizagem \u00e9 o aluno, n\u00e3o o professor, que deve incentivar e propor atividades que valorizem as intera\u00e7\u00f5es interpessoais. Para tanto, alguns pap\u00e9is enraizados na escola precisam ser revistos. Outros pap\u00e9is, por sua vez, precisam ser mantidos. A reflex\u00e3o sobre a postura do professor \u00e9 a proposta de estudo desta aula!\n\nO espa\u00e7o escolar em uma perspectiva h\u00edbrida\n-Em um ambiente de ensino h\u00edbrido e personalizado, os espa\u00e7os da escola, principalmente a sala de aula, podem ser modificados e transformados em espa\u00e7os que favore\u00e7am o processo de ensino-aprendizagem. O modo como os espa\u00e7os s\u00e3o organizados pode influenciar os pap\u00e9is de todos os envolvidos nesse processo, possibilitando que objetivos pedag\u00f3gicos sejam alcan\u00e7ados mais eficientemente a partir de um uso inteligente das oportunidades que cada ambiente e seu modo de organiza\u00e7\u00e3o proporcionam. Como aproveitar novos espa\u00e7os e organizar os alunos para potencializar a aprendizagem? Vamos discutir sobre isso?\n\nO estudante e sua autonomia no Ensino H\u00edbrido\n-Uma das vantagens do uso de estrat\u00e9gias de personaliza\u00e7\u00e3o no modelo de ensino h\u00edbrido est\u00e1 na melhoria do engajamento dos alunos. Por ser algo novo para educadores e educandos, \u00e9 esperado que a adapta\u00e7\u00e3o dos estudantes e do professor aconte\u00e7a de forma gradativa, assim como ser\u00e1 gradativa a apropria\u00e7\u00e3o dos elementos envolvidos em um modelo de ensino h\u00edbrido. Nesta aula, o foco ser\u00e1 a reflex\u00e3o sobre formas de possibilitar a autonomia do estudante, o engajamento com os pares e a personaliza\u00e7\u00e3o em um modelo de ensino h\u00edbrido.\n\nO uso das tecnologias digitais no contexto escolar\n-As tecnologias j\u00e1 est\u00e3o presentes nas escolas e dentro das salas de aulas de formas diferentes. Elas t\u00eam sido muito importantes na descoberta de novas maneiras de ensinar e aprender, possibilitando novos olhares para professores e alunos. Por\u00e9m, somente inserir as tecnologias digitais em sala de aula n\u00e3o significa - e est\u00e1 longe de significar - que o ensino esteja sendo transformado. Deve-se refletir profundamente sobre quais recursos se quer inserir em sala de aula, em quais momentos inserir determinado recurso e, principalmente, como associ\u00e1-los ao objetivo da aprendizagem que se pretende atingir! Essa ser\u00e1 a proposta de reflex\u00e3o desta aula! Vamos l\u00e1?\n\nComo avaliar em uma perspectiva h\u00edbrida?\n-Em um ambiente de ensino h\u00edbrido e personalizado a proposta \u00e9 que a avalia\u00e7\u00e3o seja ressignificada. Ela passa a expressar a exist\u00eancia de mais instrumentos no aux\u00edlio ao desenvolvimento do aluno. Da mesma maneira, a avalia\u00e7\u00e3o deixa de ocorrer em um ponto no fim do percurso e passa a ocorrer ao longo do processo. Seus resultados passam a prestar informa\u00e7\u00f5es que ajudam o educador a intervir na trajet\u00f3ria de aprendizagem do aluno para que ele tenha mais sucesso! Vamos refletir sobre esta tem\u00e1tica?\n\nReflex\u00f5es sobre a cultura escolar na contemporaneidade\n-Qual o significado da express\u00e3o \u201ccultura escolar\u201d? Trata-se da cultura dos alunos? Trata-se de princ\u00edpios e valores que definem a pol\u00edtica pedag\u00f3gica de uma escola? Ou seu sistema de gest\u00e3o? Analisar as dimens\u00f5es culturais dentro da escola e relacionar as suas modifica\u00e7\u00f5es com novas pr\u00e1ticas de ensino \u00e9 a proposta desta aula. Vamos l\u00e1?\n\nA gest\u00e3o escolar e a implementa\u00e7\u00e3o de novos desafios\n-Quando falamos em escola, para muitos, a palavra gest\u00e3o est\u00e1 associada apenas \u00e0 figura do diretor. Administrar, gerenciar, direcionar, organizar, gerir, decidir e escolher os caminhos e os investimentos da escola s\u00e3o as atribui\u00e7\u00f5es que complementam essa associa\u00e7\u00e3o. Ser\u00e1 que a complexidade de uma gest\u00e3o escolar pode ser atribu\u00edda apenas a uma pessoa ou a um cargo? Qual o papel na gest\u00e3o em um processo de implementa\u00e7\u00e3o do Ensino H\u00edbrido? Vamos refletir sobre isso?\n\nReflex\u00f5es e conclus\u00f5es finais\n-Conclu\u00edmos que o Ensino H\u00edbrido busca discutir n\u00e3o somente sobre a inser\u00e7\u00e3o de tecnologias digitais em um plano de aula. Envolve uma an\u00e1lise metodol\u00f3gica sobre o melhor caminho a seguir, a percep\u00e7\u00e3o de que o aluno deve estar sempre no centro do processo e que, para isso, a postura do professor, a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o do espa\u00e7o, a a\u00e7\u00e3o da gest\u00e3o escolar, a fun\u00e7\u00e3o da avalia\u00e7\u00e3o e a reflex\u00e3o sobre a cultura devem ser analisadas. Lembre-se de que o curso n\u00e3o teve o objetivo de apresentar solu\u00e7\u00f5es prontas, mas de compartilhar com voc\u00ea experi\u00eancias e conhecimentos para que todos possam aprender juntos! Esperamos que tenha gostado dessa pequena jornada conosco! Agora, coloque a m\u00e3o na massa e repense a sua pr\u00e1tica pedag\u00f3gica!",

Use nested if-elses in examples where there are three or more options. Design your own conditional system, re-create Snap programs based on video solutions, and review some common debugging tips.\n\nNested If/Else Part 2\n-Continue with nested if-else statements with our non-interactive programming puzzles to check your knowledge. Get prepared to run classroom discussions on some challenging if-else statements and explore a different, free, online programming system -- pencilcode.net\n\nCompound Conditionals Part 1\n-Learn how to create compound conditionals with and and or. Do an unplugged activity to see compound conditional apply in a soccer game. See how truth tables define the behavior of Boolean operators and and or and get the chance to fill one in. Create your own compound conditional programs using Snap, review others' work, and learn debugging tips.\n\nCompound Conditionals Part 2\n-Deepen your understanding of compound conditionals with some pretty challenging classroom discussion questions. Learn about the design behind the Scratch programming language and read and use starter code in Scratch to create a soccer game that announces goals and various out of bounds situations.\n\nEquity & Pedagogy\n-Explore the equity and pedagogical aspects of computer science. Learn about Grace Hopper, an iconic woman and pioneer of computing and learn about debugging tips. After practicing your debugging skills, you will learn the benefits and methods to introduce computer science to everyone. Finally, we'll introduce various communities and share advice that will be useful for computing education leaders.",

        "overview": "Level Up! covers the complete Advanced Placement* Computer Science A course in unique and engaging ways. It's a significant change of pace from other online introductory programming courses. While you will rigorously learn the art of programming in Java, you will spend much of your time designing and writing games and simulations.  This course has no textbook because all the materials are online.

Faculty members want to understand their students\u2019 backgrounds and to learn whether their teaching techniques are effective. Staff members want to be sure the advice they provide is appropriate and find out whether college requirements accomplish their goals. Administrators want to explore how all of their students and faculty are doing and to anticipate emerging changes. The public wants to know what happens in college and why.\nEveryone has questions. We have the chance to help them find answers.\nLearning analytics is about using data to improve teaching and learning. You might wonder why there\u2019s suddenly so much conversation about this previously invisible topic.[1] After all, institutions of higher education have maintained careful records of student progress and outcomes for more than a century.  They have always been ready to provide a transcript for every student, reporting all courses taken, grades received, honors awarded, and degrees conferred. Institutional research offices provide summaries of these student records to campus leaders, accreditation agencies, and the public. Why learning analytics now?\nTwo major trends drive the current emergence of learning analytics. First, data informing teaching and learning are increasingly extensive and accessible. Second, innovative new analytic approaches to digesting, visualizing, and acting on these data emerge every day.",

Small plate users will watch a few video lectures about their topic, complete a short quiz on the content, download the data and R code, and run an analysis to answer some simple questions. Users who choose the entr\u00e9e will go further, extending the code in both instructor-specified and student defined ways. The really ambitious will repeat and extend these analyses using their own, local data. An introductory video for each course will outline what it includes and provide some sense of what users at each level will experience.\nTo keep the focus on the practical, the five courses are designed to explore analyses of interest to different audiences: students, instructors, department leaders, campus-wide leaders, and course designers.\nLA for students: How to become the student you want to be?

Let's turn our students from passive consumers of technology into active producers of technology. Let's get them to develop apps, design games and start their own websites.\nTechnology is everywhere, if we like it or not. And nearly all future jobs require us to understand it. To respond to this, governments are including computing in national curricula, as a subject taught at all ages but also as part of other subjects. This means the responsibility is on to us, the teachers, because we need to teach it. In the UK already every primary school teacher has to teach computing concepts and in many other countries more and more of us will be required to teach computing or at least integrate computing concepts, ideas and processes into the teacher of our subjects. So let's get ready for this.\nIf you are a Computer Science teacher who needs new ideas, tools or resources on how to teach your subject. If you are an Art teacher who suddenly has to talk about website design, user experience and user interfaces in your subject. If you are a Biology teacher who has to teach your students how to programme sensors taking important measurements in an experiment. This MOOC is here to help you.

Last but not least will identify a set of fellow course participants who are facing similar challenges and establish informal connections with them in order to share resources and expertise and support each other after the course.

        "overview": "Asking questions is a vital part of any learning process, and within the life sciences there is certainly a lot to explore! Inquiry-Based Science Education (IBSE) is beneficial for many reasons and not only for students, but teachers too.\nIt is primarily a shift from the mere passing on of information, to the stimulation of students\u2019 curiosity and motivation for them to inquire. IBSE allows students to be in control of their own learning process and acquire knowledge in a more interactive way.\nOn the other hand, IBSE methodologies give teachers the opportunity to present the curriculum from a new angle and to follow students\u2019 development on a unique scale. This way, Inquiry Based-Teaching makes the classroom a space of curious learning and more flexible teaching.\nThe Inquiry-Based Teaching in Life Sciences MOOC is meant to enhance life science teachers\u2019 pedagogical competences and practices, and improve their conceptual understanding of life science to help them further establish and disseminate IBSE.\nThe MOOC will offer a selection of tested classroom activities and resources from a number of European countries to empower life science teachers to introduce IBSE methodologies to students aged 12-19, and help them reflect on their own practices.",

        "syllabus": "What it means to be a professional\n-This week we will consider what it means to be a teaching professional. We will ask you to think about your own beliefs about teaching and education in light of the expectations that society has for teachers. We will also reflect on the importance of the teacher and the school to the achievement and development of each child. At the end of this week you will have engaged in a personal reflective process to assist you to think about teaching, what is expected of teachers, and what teaching entails. This is something that we will continue to examine and develop in the remaining parts of the course.\n\nEthics, codes of conduct and standards for teachers\n-Now that we have started to consider teaching as a profession, we will begin to reflect on professional behaviour and ethics in more detail. We will look at the various means that are used to ensure that agreed professional standards are met. The topics covered are: professional ethics; professional distance; the features and uses of professional standards for teachers; the formal procedures around the accreditation of teacher education courses, teacher registration, certification, appraisal, and performance management; and teacher behaviour and codes of conduct. You'll also be encouraged to reflect upon what happens in your particular school or context and how this compares with these more general expectations for teachers and schools held by society and in various parts of the world.\n\nLegal and administrative responsibilities of a teacher\n-This week we will consider the roles that statute law, judge-made law and case law play in teaching and schooling. We will examine the concept of duty of care, the care that is owed to students by their teachers and school, and its implications for your professional practice. We will also consider the rights and responsibilities of students, parents, caregivers, and teachers. What is and is not reasonable for parents and students to ask for in relation to schooling? You will be encouraged to reflect upon your professional behaviour as a teacher and to consider how these issues might impact upon current practices in your classroom and in your school. You will also be encouraged to discuss these issues with your principal, colleagues, and other course participants.\n\nDeveloping a personal philosophy of teaching\n-Building on the last three weeks, we will now consider the importance of developing a personal philosophy of teaching. We will look at the impact that teaching and schools can have on student learning and development, and on student lives more generally. We will examine research that demonstrates how and why views on the impact of teaching have changed over time, and consider some of the big challenges we face in ensuring that every student has access to quality teaching. We will also examine the concept of socio-economic status and its influence on student achievement. An important issue we will emphasize this week is the need for all teaching strategies and approaches to have a strong evidence base grounded in research. We will utilize effect size research to consider those strategies which have lesser and greater effects on student learning. We encourage you to reflect upon your values, beliefs, and current philosophy of teaching.\n\nBeing part of a professional learning community\n-Professional learning has a powerful role in improving teaching and learning. We will consider its impact by looking at research that demonstrates its influence on teacher quality and student outcomes. This will be complemented with case studies of professional learning communities. Some of the most effective types of professional learning are collaborative forms, which are increasingly being utilized through approaches such as action learning. We will consider these collaborative forms, and also look at the use of cycles of enquiry as a means of enhancing the professional learning of teachers. We will also examine the importance and influence of leadership of teachers\u2019 professional learning. In particular, we will look at the various leadership behaviours, actions, and strategies which have been found to be most effective, including instructional leadership. In completing this week\u2019s work you will be encouraged to reflect upon your own professional learning and the professional learning available to you and your colleagues. You will also consider the benefits that arise from teachers working together to enhance their professional learning in order to address issues or problems in their school.\n\nContinuing to develop as a professional\n-We will conclude this course by examining the need for a teacher to continue to develop as a professional. It is important for teachers to periodically reflect on their teaching, engage in self-assessment, and set goals for future professional learning and development. We will explore important aspects of professional learning such as personal reflection and collaborative reflection, feedback, and observation tools such as rubrics. We encourage you to consider your own professional development needs and develop a personal professional development plan for the next few years. We will conclude this course by asking you to sum up what you have learnt, what might have changed your thinking and how you might change any aspects of your practice in the future.",

        "syllabus": "Introduction to the Course\n-Welcome to 'Teaching EFL/ESL Reading: A Task Based Approach!'.\n\nWhat is Task-based Language Teaching (TBLT)?\n-Welcome to module 1! In this module we will be looking at some key concepts and issues that surround the role of tasks in second language learning and teaching. First, we will define what we mean by the notion of task. Then, we will consider different task types and the role of tasks in the syllabus. We will also discuss the rationale for using tasks in second language teaching, and how task-based lessons and sequences are typically organized. The module ends with an interview with Dr. Nick Andon from Kings' College London, who is an international expert on task-based language teaching.\n\nWhat is Reading and What Does It Involve?\n-Welcome to module 2! In this module we examine reading from a number of angles. We start by examining the cognitive element of reading. The second angle we examine reading from is reading as a communicative activity, and its links with communicative language teaching. We then look at reading as a strategic activity, and at the links between reading and background knowledge, and look at the way in which background knowledge is needed in order to understand three specific texts. We end by discussing ways of developing reading fluency.\n\nTeaching Reading in the Second Language Classroom\n-\nWelcome to module 3! In this module we will be thinking about the ways in which we teach reading in the foreign and second language classroom. We start by comparing the ways in which we read outside the classroom and the ways in which we ask our learners to reading in the classroom. We think about principles for reading in the communicative language classroom and about the implications of these principles. We go on to consider the three-phase reading lesson and look closely at an example of such a lesson, and then look at other ways in which we can construct reading lessons, focusing on the way in which we can incorporate tasks into such lessons. We end with an interview with Prof. Cathie Wallace, who talks about her research into reading classrooms.\n\n\nFocus on Language in the Reading Lesson\n-Welcome to module 4! In this module we will be looking at how a focus on language, such as grammar and vocabulary, can be integrated into task-based reading sequences. First, we will consider some of the options available in terms of the stages of the task-based reading lesson. Next, we will look at each stage in more detail. We will discuss the usefulness of pre-teaching vocabulary. We will examine how a focus on language can be incorporated at the while-reading stage. In particular, we will review research on two textual modification techniques, glossing and textual input enhancement. We will also reflect on ways of selecting linguistic features for language-focused work in the post-reading phase. The module ends with an interview with Dr. Parvaneh Tavakoli, a well-known researcher working on task-based language teaching.\n\nExtensive Reading\n-Welcome to module 5! In this module we move away from the intensive teaching of reading in the classroom to working with learners on extensive reading. We define extensive reading and look at the main principles of using extensive reading. We discuss the benefits of extensive reading programmes, as well as the way in which extensive reading can be linked to task based language teaching. We end with an interview with Dr. Sam Duncan in which she talks about her experience of running a reading circle with a group of adult literacy and ESOL learners.\n\nDesigning Reading Tasks\n-Welcome to the last module on our MOOC. In this module we will focus on the way in which we can write materials: we will think about sources for texts, about finding suitable tasks for texts, and will practice write new tasks for texts that you have already read. We will end with two interviews: one with Caroline Herring, a teacher in London who talks about materials she wrote for her own learners, and the second with Prof. Pauline Foster, who talks about reading and reading tasks.",

You will also examine the role of reading in real-life and in second and foreign language teaching and current thinking about the interface between TBLT and second language reading. You will explore how TBLT and teaching second language reading can be successfully integrated in practice through analysing task-based reading materials. The course culminates in creating task-based materials for teaching reading in your own language teaching contexts. \n\nAfter completing the course, you will be able to: \n1.\tExplain the main components and tenets of a task-based approach to teaching language;\n2.\tExplain the main issues involved in teaching reading;\n3.\tIllustrate connections between TBLT approaches and the teaching of reading;  \n4.\tIntegrate tasks into your own teaching; \n5.\tIdentify reading texts that are suitable for the construction of tasks; and \n6.\tConstruct reading tasks and sequences for use in your own classroom.",

We'll learn about why you should care about the Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles course and review teacher guidance for the Explore Task students are asked to do to evaluate impacts of computing on our society, economy and culture.\n\nEvaluating Student Work\n-Being a teacher, I'm sure I don't have to convince you -- there's no better way to prepare to excel on an assessment than grading the work of others! This week you'll apply the Explore Task Grading Checklist to real high school student work and share and learn from others about the kind of feedback you would provide these students!\n\nComputational Artifact & Feedback\n-This week you have time to work on your own Explore Task that you will submit as the capstone project. Remember, if you want to get UC, San Diego transcript credit you need to enroll in a UC, San Diego Extension course before you do your project! This week you will create and share your computational artifact. Next week, we'll finish the project!\n\nFinal Project\n-This is it! Time to finish your project and show off your knowledge! Don't forget, if you need or want to get UC, San Diego transcript credit, you need to sign up on UC, San Diego Extension NOW -- before you do the work for this week!\n\nReview and Reflect\n-Now that you've finished your project, be sure to review the work of 3 of your peers to earn your points for your Peer Review!",

This material is part of the Teaching Statistics Through Data Investigations course. If you need a review, or if you have not yet had the opportunity, please engage with these materials before you work on Unit 1.\nUnit 1: What is Inferential Reasoning?\nIn this unit, you learn core aspects of inferential reasoning, why it is important in statistics, and how it develops, from informal approaches with early learners to more formal approaches as learners get more sophisticated, as described in the SASI framework. In the Posing Questions phase of an investigation, you will learn three general types of questions that can provide opportunities for students to build inferential reasoning skills. Each type of question will be the focus of the next three units.\nUnit 2: Inferential Reasoning with Comparing Groups\nIn this unit, we take a deep dive into questions that provide opportunities for learners to compare two or more groups. When learners have a need to find similarities or difference among distributions, their understanding of key characteristics of distributions becomes an essential aspect of making comparative statements and generalizing beyond the data at hand. You will get to experience investigating a comparing groups question, see samples of students work, and consider other tasks for their potential to promote inferential reasoning.",

        "syllabus": "The lives of children\n-How much, as teachers or parents, do we understand about the lives of children and what affects their learning? How is their identity shaped, who shapes it, and in what circumstances? How many different \u2018selves\u2019 do children inhabit and how does their \u2018self\u2019 emerge in different contexts? How are boys and girls affected differently by their upbringing and the expectations we hold of them? And how do these issues play out in the multi-cultural school and classroom? We will consider these important questions in the materials this week.\n\nHow children learn\n-We know a lot about children\u2019s learning, but there is a lot that we still have to learn. How important is self-confidence and self-esteem? What do we understand by \u2018agency\u2019, the confidence to take initiative, to learn for yourself and with others? In what ways do schools and teachers often discourage agency, and how may learning be fostered in the classroom and in out-of-school contexts? How can teachers take account of so many different learning needs and \u2018styles\u2019 and differentiate teaching for different individuals and groups? And how can teachers involve children in shaping rules and roles in the classroom? These are the issues discussed over the course of these four lectures.\n\nEngaging with students\n-The theme for this week is 'engaging with students'. We begin with the language of the classroom, the crucial issue of questioning how and for what purpose children are rewarded, and the use of paired and group work to engage students more actively in the lesson. We start with the question - How would you describe the nature of social interactions within: Your own classroom? Your own school? Your own country? This is a vital starting point as everything else hangs on relationships and, as discussed at the end of week two, a shared understanding of rules and roles lays the groundwork for a collaborative classroom ethos.\n\nThe power of the peer group\n-The four lectures this week are all related to the theme of peer groups. We look at the positive and negative effects of peer groups, including how smoking drugs and alcohol problems can affect the classroom and the school, the concerning issue of bullying, and the problems that emerge when we label students in particular ways. I encourage you to write a narrative in which you bring together a reflection on your own classroom, the relationships that peers have within it and how this impacts on your teaching. At the end of this week we are offering you the second interview between myself and Professor John MacBeath, where will discuss some of the issues that arose during weeks three and four. Also, this week, as well as the quiz, you should be starting to finalise the second peer assessment essay.\n\nLearning that travels\n-This week we consider how learning happens as it travels out of the classroom. We consider ways in which students learn at home, including the thorny problem of homework, and the important understanding of how transitions, from one school to another or from one place to another, can impact on our learning. We consider how we might use indicators to make judgements about how well our students are learning and how we can make adjustments in the school to maximise the use of indicators.\n\nFour key thinkers\n-Who are the great thinkers that have shaped our understanding of education and schooling? Whose insights have benefited our thinking and practice often without even knowing it? In this sixth week of the course we will discuss four key thinkers (from Nigeria, the U.S, and Russia). They are Pai Obanya, David Perkins, Abraham Maslow and Lev Vygotsky.",

You do not need an art background or museum access to successfully integrate the course materials into your teaching. Your willingness to experiment with new teaching practices is all that is required.\n\nThe strategies presented in this course are adapted from Artful Thinking pedagogy, developed by Project Zero at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. You will explore three thinking dispositions, using eight thinking routines that are easy to understand and implement with STEAM curricular content.\nStarting with the disposition of observing and describing, you will learn how to guide your students in slowing down, using their senses, and communicating impressions of what they see in a work of art...and in other things.\nNext, the routines used in the disposition of reasoning with evidence ask students to make hypotheses about the art and support their arguments with observations.\nFinally, the questioning and investigating disposition challenges students to hone their natural curiosity by expressing their wonderings and formulating open-ended questions.\nThroughout, you will discover the power of art to develop your students\u2019 inclination, motivation, and ability to think deeply.\n\n\nWhen you enroll, all the resources you need for your classroom to strengthen critical thinking by using art will be immediately available. We recommend spending a few hours learning and practicing each section before progressing to the next.\n\n\nThe online course environment features over 20 videos and interactive tools:\n\nParticipating with a global network of educators who, just like you, want to hone their abilities to teach critical thinking skills and explore arts integration will be an added bonus to your course experience.",

        "overview": "Supporting English Language Learners under New Standards is an eight-week, online course designed to help teachers support English language learners in meeting new, rigorous standards. Specifically, the course will focus on a key practice within both the Common Core State Standards and new English Language Proficiency Standards: constructing claims supported by evidence.\nEndorsed by the Oregon Department of Education for Oregon K-12 teachers, the content is also open to teachers outside of Oregon and is especially relevant to those educators in the 11-state ELPA21 consortium.\nLearn how to design curriculum aligned to new standards\nIn this course, teachers and administrators from across Oregon and beyond will work together in teams, gaining direct experience with the new, rigorous standards. Together, participants will gather language samples from their students and collaboratively analyze those samples, exploring how students construct claims supported by evidence. Using what they learn about their students' language abilities, educators will be able to more successfully design curriculum aligned to the new standards.",

        "syllabus": "Teaching and Learning: Key Beliefs\nLectures during the first week will introduce students to the Match Teacher Residency\u2019s key beliefs around teaching and learning. Week 1 will discuss the dynamics of classroom learning as well as the complexly layered decisions that teachers make during every period of instruction. Students will be asked to complete a quiz covering lecture material as well as a quiz on a short supplemental reading. We recommend approaching the material by first watching the lecture videos and then doing the associated reading. Afterwards, the quiz is a summative assessment that allows you to demonstrate mastery of the Week 1 material.\n\nConsistency\nLectures during the second week will introduce students to the concepts of Consistency and Automaticity in classroom management. Without the ability to make certain predictable management decisions on a minute-to-minute basis, a rookie teacher will have trouble devoting sufficient mental \"bandwidth\" to higher-level teaching decisions about content, rigor, engagement, etc. Students will be asked to complete the Week 2 Quiz covering lecture material and a short supplemental reading. During Week 2 you will also complete your first peer-reviewed planning assignment. We recommend approaching the material by first watching the lecture videos and pausing to do the associated reading when prompted. Alternatively, watch the videos in their entirety and then do the reading.\n\n\nLectures during Week 3 will focus on the concept of \"Ratio\" in the classroom: how much of the mental heavy lifting are your students doing relative to you, their teacher? Ratio has two dimensions: participation ratio (the number of students involved), and thinking ratio (the rigor of the task students are engaged in). In an ideal classroom, the teacher is doing relatively little of the high-level thinking, and (all) students are consistently engaged in those rigorous cognitive tasks. Week 3 will also introduce a strategy for boosting the ratio in your own classroom: the Turn and Talk.\n\n\nDo you call your students or their parents at home? While there is a lot of anecdotal evidence to suggest that building relationships with students can increase classroom effort, many teachers don't proactively try to do similar outreach to the parents or guardians of their students. Week 4 offers anecdotes and a rigorous scientific study on the value of calling home. We try to make the case for why calling home is too effective *not* to do, then offers detailed advice on how to script \"the praise call\" and \"the correction call.\" This week, in addition to the quiz, you'll also be asked to do a short written assignment in which you plan and script phone calls to your students or their parents.

Design of Courses in an Instructional System Design framework and planning the Instruction (Module 2 and Module 3) follow after designing good Course Outcomes in the framework provided by NBA.\nThe quality of Teaching And Learning in Engineering (TALE) has come to be an important issue in India to all stakeholders including teachers, students, parents, Managements, University, AICTE, NBA and Industry. The quality of learning of the graduating engineers determines the quality of their placements. Industry, Regulatory Bodies and Accreditation Agencies in India want the engineering graduates attain a set of Program Outcomes (knowledge, skills and attitudes) which are discipline agnostic and a set of Program Specific Outcomes identified by the Department offering the program. The curriculum of a program decides the nature of learning experiences including the courses, projects, internships, and co-curricular and extra-curricular activities.\nThe focus on students attaining a certain set of outcomes requires a shift from teacher centric approach to student centric instruction. While good teachers, in any era or in any part of the world, were and are always student centric in their approach the process of designing and conducting a course remained informal in nature. The contexts of instruction including quality and background of students, teacher expertise, physical environment and the system in which instruction takes place, available resources, regulatory and accreditation mechanisms, and assessment and evaluation mechanisms are extremely varied. There is no unique method that leads to good learning in all contexts. The course TALE addresses many of the common issues of teaching and learning in engineering in the Indian context and tries to provide a complete solution to a teacher to the process of design and conduct of an engineering course leaving all the academic freedom he/she wants to have. While at some places the solutions appear to be specific they can be treated as examples, and alternate solutions can be worked out by the teacher.",

As educators, we want all of our students to be successful and feel supported in an inclusive learning environment. Many of our students have disabilities that they may or may not disclose to faculty and staff. Typically, the process of providing required documentation and identifying appropriate accommodations is a collaborative effort between the student and the disability services staff. Faculty are not a part of this process and may not be aware of the rationale or implications. In this week, we will begin with an introduction to students with disabilities. Week 1 highlights the key United States legislation that relates to higher education students with disabilities and describes the process of obtaining support services.\n\nAccommodations and Assistive Technology\n-This week we describe the process used for deciding on reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities and the role of Disability Services in making this determination. We identify specific accommodations that students with disabilities might need in order to fully participate in life at the university.\n\nAccessible Design\n-In Weeks 1 and 2, we reviewed disability definitions and legislation, plus the disability services, accommodations, and technologies that you might find on your college campus. In Week 3, we focus on the design and development of your course materials. We use the term \u201cuniversal design\u201d to emphasize the inclusive design of instruction to make it meaningful and useful for all students. We also look at best practices for documents such as using clear fonts, organizing text with headings, and describing images with alternative text.\n\n\nApplication\n-Please read the following case studies and respond to the corresponding questions on the discussion boards.",

        "syllabus": "Discover the visually impaired child\n-Welcome to the first week of the course! In this week, we take you on a journey to explore visual impairment and in doing so, help you discover the visually impaired child in your classroom. We consider the different educational settings in which visually impaired children may find themselves as well as different eye conditions and how these circumstances may affect the child\u2019s learning and behaviour in the classroom. You will also start with the important task of creating an empowering classroom by learning how to create an inclusive space. At the end of the week, I have invited a group of visually impaired professionals to discuss some of the issues based on their experience. You will also have the opportunity to share your thoughts in the discussion forum and look through the list of further resources we provide. This week\u2019s assessment is a quiz. May you have a rich and empowering first week.\n\nThe Expanded Core Curriculum for the visually impaired child\n-Welcome to the second week of the course! This week we will deal in some detail with the Expanded Core Curriculum (or ECC). This is a collection of content areas that teachers integrate into the core curriculum to give visually impaired learners access to the incidental knowledge that sighted learners gain through observation. Various guest presenters will discuss the areas of the ECC, bringing you their specialist knowledge. A Braille specialist will introduce what Braille tuition may involve and provide a set of principles to support learners who are being taught Braille. At the end of the week, the panel discussion focuses on the ECCs potential to empower visually impaired learners. You will have an opportunity to share your insights on the discussion forum and add to your learning from the additional resources provided. The assessment this week is a written exercise where you can practice applying the ECC to a lesson of your choice.\n\nCurriculum differentiation and assistive technology\n-Welcome to the third week of the course! In this week you will learn about the need and importance of differentiating the curriculum for the children with visual impairment. This means modifying and adapting the curriculum according to the different abilities and learning styles of learners within a class. You will also learn about identifying suitable learning and teaching support material, assessment adaptations, and assistive technology devices or programs for each individual child with visual impairment. The week concludes as usual with opinions and experiences from our expert panel, an opportunity to share your thoughts with your peers in the discussion forum, additional resources to explore, and a graded quiz. This week you also have an opportunity to cover additional content on making learning materials accessible for the voluntary honors assignment.\n\nBecoming an empowered teacher\n-Welcome to the last week on the course! In this week, you will gain further understanding about the importance of tending to psycho-social issues of visually impaired children by listening to them with respect, patience, and compassion. We will also describe practical things you can do to broaden your networks of support. Then you will hear from an experienced school principal about empowering yourself and your school through collaboration s. As it is the last week, we have invited our panellist to discuss this week\u2019s topics as well as offering a final reflection on creating inclusive classrooms. The end of course assessment is a graded quiz, and we will leave you with a rich set of resources to support your endeavour to becoming an empowered teacher.",

There has been an old saying that \u201cWe are endowed with certain talent and weakness, and everything seems to predetermined as our fate.\u201d With the advancement of biological research, genomics and genetics, there are loads of examples illustrating that our genetic composition dictates who we are to a large extent. But, how large? In this lecture, Prof. Chow will go through some of these examples revealing how much it is truth, and how much it is just a myth with the audience. With a better understanding of the human biology as scientific facts, we hope you would no longer feel haunted by your fate, and would appreciate how much you can change your life by choice and by luck.\n\nDo Chinese have Romantic Love? (By Prof. Michelle Yik)\n-The third module is contributed by Prof. Michelle Yik, 2010 recipient of HKUST Michael G. Gale Medal. If you wish to learn about whether Chinese have romantic love but are not sure where to kick off that journey, this is a romantic module for you.\n\nIntroduction to Computer Networking (By Prof. Percy Dias)\n-The fourth module is contributed by Prof. Percy Dias, 2016 recipient of HKUST Michael G. Gale Medal. A computer network is a set of computers connected together for the purpose of sending and receiving information. The Internet itself can be considered a computer network. The connection between computers can be done via cabling, most commonly the Ethernet cable, or wirelessly through radio waves. Connected computers can share resources, like access to the Internet, printers, file servers, and others. A network is a multipurpose connection, which allows a single computer to do more. In this lecture, Prof. Dias will demonstrate to us how these hard-to-visualize concepts can be delivered to students in an easy-to-learn way with fun.\n\nFinal Assignment\n-This final module aims to tie what you have learnt to the course learning objectives through a final assignment.",

Unfortunately many History/Social Studies teachers have not had significant instruction and/or practice in historical writing. Worse, very few teacher professional development seminars focus on this topic. This course will help social studies teachers: (1) identify the characteristics of high quality writing, (2) improve argumentative writing, (3) improve informative or explanatory writing, (4) improve narrative writing, (5) conduct rubric validation, and (6) incorporate peer review and revision memos.\nThis six-week course will provide playlists of video lectures, leveled readings, and grade-level & subject-focused bulletin board discussions on improving historical writing. Exercises and activities will draw from the Common Core State Standards, the C3 Social Studies Framework, the National Social Science Standards, and the Framework for 21st Century Skills and provide a vertically articulated sequence of skills to explicitly teach in the future.",

        "syllabus": "Why do we need 21st century skills? What are they?\n-During our introduction week, we provide two Modules. Module 1 offers an overview of the course and explains how assessment in it is structured. Our approach to assessment in the course introduces some developmental components that complement the summative approach used by Coursera for grading. The Course Progression provides the basis of the self-assessment activities provided throughout the course. These enable you to monitor your progress as you develop your skills in teaching and assessing C21 skills. In Module 2 we turn to the first topics of the course, and discuss the world in terms of technological change and the need for 21st century skills in today\u2019s workforce. We talk about what is meant by '21st century skills' and how these skills are increasingly in demand as new technologies change the way we work, learn, live and function in a digital and knowledge-based society. You will have the opportunity to learn about different 21st century skills frameworks that have been created by a variety of institutions. We want to show you what we mean by a developmental approach, and how this approach can be used in assessment and learning and teaching. These lectures will form the foundation for topics to come in later weeks, so please take the time to watch them and to follow up with the suggested readings.\n\nHow to teach and assess Collaborative Problem Solving (CPS) as an example of a C21 skill\n-In Module 3 we introduce collaborative problem solving (CPS), an example of a complex and relevant 21st century skill. We will explain the nature of CPS, describing in depth the underlying competencies involved in this skill. We will explain how we can take a developmental approach to teaching and learning in CPS and how skills progressions can be developed and used for formative assessment and teaching purposes. We deal with this topic at a relatively deep level, in preparation for taking a more practical approach in Weeks 3 and 4.\n\nAssessing and reporting on the development of collaborative problem solving skills\n-This week, in Module 4, you will be reviewing aspects of assessing students\u2019 collaborative problem solving skills using a developmental approach. You will review a video of ICT tasks that the ATC21S team have created, and you will be prompted to think of ways these approaches may be used, in the classroom or in professional learning, to teach and assess CPS. Work in Week 3 of the course combines with work in Weeks 2 and 4 to support development of the learning outcomes described in Strand 3 of the course progression.\n\nDevelopmental teaching of collaborative problem solving\n-In Week 4, Module 5, we discuss how individual and group differences can be managed in teaching CPS. We conduct interviews with a teacher, school leader and researcher on implementing the assessment and teaching of 21st century skills in schools. We also discuss, in interview format, the complexities of assessing sophisticated CPS skills using seemingly uncomplicated tasks. How can we assist students to develop their skills from their current level of social and cognitive CPS skill levels, to progress towards greater expertise? This week, too, you should begin work on your major course assignment.\n\nKnowing how to learn in a MOOC: another example of a C21 skill\n-This week, in Module 6 we explore a further example of a C21 skill, and one that has particular relevance to participants in this course: the skill of knowing how to learn in a MOOC. We review the nature of MOOCs as a teaching environment, and why a MOOC demands particular learning skill to generate higher learning. We examine an empirical progression for the skill, and review how to assess the level of skill of any participant in a MOOC. Module 7 is focused on your major assignment, which is is due this week.\n\nReflection and looking forward\n-In this final week, in Module 8, we ask you to reflect on your learning in the course and particularly on the use of progressions and developmental thinking in the way C21 skills are taught and assessed. If you submitted an Assignment in Week 5, you will assess the work of your peers in the major Assignment.",

Strategies for extensive reading, such as reading for pleasure and reading for connection are also discussed.\n\nOvercoming Writing Difficulties: Hansel and Gretel, or How to Literally Get Out of a Jam\n-In this module, learners are introduced to the writing process, with attention paid to pre-writing, writing, and post-writing activities. Learners also explore the concepts of recursion and appropriation.\n\nWriting Techniques: Aladdin and the 1,000 Arabian Nights\n-In this module, learners are given the opportunity to learn about strategies from good writers, in particular, how good writing is generated from reading, speaking, and critical thinking. Learners are also introduced to the six traits of writing, and the need to consider both voice and audience.\n\nThe Princess and the Pea\n-In this module, learners are given the opportunity to think about how to integrate grammar into a reading and writing class. Teachers are taught the principle of noticing, and the importance of noticing for both learner and instructor. Teachers are also taught about how to enhance input in order to help students notice, and hopefully, acquire language.\n\nAssessment\n-Watch the final review video to verify your understanding of the course material. Then proceed to the final checkpoint quiz.",

        "overview": "The Surviving your First Years of Teaching course aims to support you in overcoming the commonly known \u201cpractice shock\u201d which most new teachers experience when moving from their initial training to their first job in the profession. This \u201cshock\u201d is often caused by inadequate preparation during the initial training phase, the changing role of teachers in schools, the increasingly complex demands on teachers and the common \u201cloneliness\u201d of new teachers working in environments where there are only experienced teachers.\nThe course offers guidance and ideas on how to deal with common challenges faced by teachers starting a job at a new school for the first time. It also provides a space to overcome any \u201cloneliness\u201d experienced as a new teacher, offering you a place to interact with peers in similar situations. Furthermore, the course makes an important link to school mentors, experienced teachers who have been trained to support new teachers in their first years.\nDuring the course we will be looking at important questions around how to integrate into a school community and find the right support as a new teacher, how to develop teaching confidence even when experiencing inevitable setbacks, how to become more time-efficient in your planning and preparations, how to develop a positive atmosphere in your classes right from the start and avoid common mistakes in the first days of the school year, as well as what tools are out there to support your daily work inside and outside of the classroom.",

We will emphasize approaches proven to be effective and show you how to implement them. We will also give you the opportunity to reflect on your own teaching experience and exchange ideas and share challenges with other learners in the course.\nWe will begin by looking at the most common method of teaching science, the lecture. We\u2019ll discuss what the lecture method does well and look at data that illustrates when it is less effective. You will hear highly successful teachers talk about their experience with lecture and how they modified their lecture time to more actively engage students. We\u2019ll investigate creating learning objectives and how they can be used to communicate your expectations to students. You will practice writing your own learning objectives and see how they can streamline exam construction. We\u2019ll look at a variety of ways to include active learning during class time, discuss how active learning strategies support your learning objectives, and give you practice developing learning activities for biology topics you find challenging to teach. \nLastly, we\u2019ll look at how to use resources for student learning outside of class, and how to know that your students have successfully learned from both in-class and outside of class activities.",

How much of that learning will have a direct impact on your teaching? On your personal and professional values? On your relationship with colleagues? With children? With parents or other adults?\n\nPractical Task Creation\n-Lesson plans. Who needs them? Don\u2019t good teachers just teach spontaneously and flexibly in response to their students? Of course many teachers do just that, especially if they have been teaching for a long time. So why engage in the laborious business of creating a lesson plan? Who is it for and what use does it serve?\n\nEvaluation phase\n-During the courses, much has been said about feedback as a key aspect of learning. As a teacher, or simply as a social being, you have been giving feedback both formally and informally over the course of your life. You have also been on the receiving end of feedback, from family, friends, colleagues, and employers. However, you might not have been given feedback before in a context such as this, from fellow course members, and virtual rather than face to face.\n\nReflection-on-action phase\n-In this final week of the Capstone course the focus is on updating and refining lesson plans, finalizing portfolios, looking back on achievements, and giving thought to what may come next.",

This 4 week course provides you with invaluable knowledge and skills about teaching Deaf children. You will learn about the importance of Deaf culture and community, the need for a language rich environment for the Deaf child from as young as possible, and that having access to sign language can help Deaf children academically, emotionally, and socially. We also cover various accommodations and modifications that you can apply in your classroom and learning environment to create an accessible learning experience for Deaf children. You will also find that a shift in attitude will enable you to connect with Deaf children with more understanding. We hope that through this course you become an empowered teacher - for yourself, for your fellow teachers, and most importantly, for the Deaf children in your classroom.\n\nYou will be able to purchase a Verified Certificate if you wish to show evidence of your achievements, but this is optional, and you may apply for Financial Aid if you are unable to pay the certificate fee.",

In this week, you will be finding out about the experience of being Deaf from school children who participated in the TEDI research project as well as from three Deaf guest presenters. Being Deaf impacts learning and it is important to start the course with this awareness. The assessment in this week is a graded quiz at the end of the week. You will also have an opportunity to share some of your thoughts and reflections in the discussion forum. We hope you enjoy the first week of the course!\n\nThe role of teachers in developing resilience in Deaf children\n-The second week in this course focuses on knowledge about the Deaf child's communication, emotional, and social development. This type of knowledge is crucial for teachers working with Deaf children, as it can inform teaching practices and greatly contribute to becoming an empowered teacher. In this week, you will hear from various experts, such as a counselor, an occupational therapist, and an audiologist, who will share their knowledge and experiences regarding Deaf children's development. At the end of this week there is a graded quiz and an opportunity for reflection through discussion. This week also includes an optional Honors lesson with a written assignment that will be reviewed by your peers.\n\nCreating an accessible learning experience\n-Welcome to the third week of the course! In this week, we will look at creating classroom and learning experiences that are accessible to Deaf children. We know that every child has a right to quality education and in the previous two weeks you have learnt about the barriers to learning that Deaf children face and how excluded they often are from education. The content we bring to you in this week will show you how you can ensure that Deaf children are able to access learning by making your classroom, teaching methods, and assessments accessible. This week includes a graded quiz at the end of the week. You will also have an opportunity to share your reflections and experiences with your peers in the discussion forum at the end of the week.\n\nBecoming an empowered teacher\n-Welcome to the last week of the course! Your journey to becoming an empowered teacher is ending. We hope that you have learnt valuable new practices in the previous three weeks. In this last week, the guest presenters discuss some internal and external aspects that you as teachers of Deaf children can focus on that can help you become a stronger and more effective teacher. These aspects include taking care of yourself, building support around you, working with teaching assistants, and collaborating with parents. By the end of the week, you will have completed your journey to becoming an empowered teacher and you will have an opportunity to reflect on the knowledge that you have gained through a written assignment that will be reviewed by your peers. You will also be able to share some reflections and final thoughts with your peers in the discussion forum at the end of the week.",

We will take a deeper dive to explore the relationship between mental health and learning. You will be introduced to a model schools can use to promote student mental health. Finally, you will meet two students \u2013 Kelsey and Javier. We will follow Kelsey and Javier throughout the entire course to illustrate the different supports available to promote student mental health and learning.\n\nTier 1 Interventions\n-In this module we will learn about interventions that all students can receive to promote social-emotional well being and prevent mental health problems. You will learn about different ways that schools can promote a positive environment, teach social-emotional skills, respond to diverse learners, support students exposed to trauma, and prevent bullying and suicide.\n\nTier 2 interventions\n-in this module we will learn about strategies that schools use for some students who are at risk of developing social-emotional or behavioral problems. We will discuss how schools create plans and monitor the success of these interventions using data. We will provide examples of different approaches that schools can use depending on the student\u2019s area of need, including interventions for behavior problems, social skills, bullying, and coping.\n\nTier 3 Interventions\n-In these final lessons, you will learn about the most intensive levels of support meant for few students with significant social-emotional or behavioral challenges. You will also learn about how students with identified special needs may also be eligible for individualized supports through 504 plans and/or Individualized Education Plans. Finally, you will find out what happened with our students - Kelsey and Javier!",

Childhood is a great time to start learning programming and to develop computational thinking, creativity, and problem- solving skills. In this course you will learn the basics of programming and how to teach it yourself as a primary or secondary school teacher.\n\nThis MOOC teaches programming in Scratch through fun videos which explain programming in an inspiring and clear way. These videos are accompanied by assignments which let kids practice programming and create programs they will like to use themselves!\n\nEvery week you build a different Scratch project yourself: a flappy bird game, a virtual pet or a Mondriaan like artwork. Also weekly, new programming blocks are taught and together we\u2019re working on ways to improve your written code. In addition, you will learn how you can integrate the same programming lessons in your class for both primary and secondary education.\n\nMany programming principles covered in Scratch also apply to other programming languages such as JavaScript and Python. An introduction to Python as well as hardware such as robotics and a micro:bit are a part of this online course should you want to broaden your scope.\n\nThe content of this course is based on a course that was used in primary schools in The Netherlands with great success. The material follows the educational curriculum for programming in primary education of The Netherlands.",

We first review the equations and characteristics of straight lines, then classify polynomial equations, define quadric surfaces and conics, and trigonometric identities and areas. In algebra we define complex numbers and logarithms, and show how to manipulate matrices and determinants. Basic properties of vectors with their manipulations and identities are presented. The discussion of series includes arithmetic and geometric progressions and Taylor and Maclaurin series. Calculus begins with definitions of derivatives and gives some standard forms and computation of critical points of curves, then presents grad, del and curl operators on scalar and vector functions. Differential equations are calcified and to methods to solve linear, homogenous equations are presented. Fourier series and transforms are defined along with standard forms, and finally Laplace transforms and their inverse are discussed. In all cases, basic ideas and equations are presented along with sample problems that illustrate the major ideas and provide practice on expected exam questions.Time: Approximately 4.5 hours | Difficulty Level: Medium\n\nProbability and Statistics\n-This module reviews the basic principles of probability and statistics covered in the FE Exam. We first review some basic parameters and definitions in statistics, such as mean and dispersion properties followed by computation of permutations and combinations. We then give the definitions of probability and the laws governing it and apply Bayes theorem. We study probability distributions and cumulative functions, and learn how to compute an expected value. Particular probability distributions covered are the binomial distribution, applied to discrete binary events, and the normal, or Gaussian, distribution. We show the meaning of confidence levels and intervals and how to use and apply them. We define and apply the central limit theorem to sampling problems and brieflyt- and c2. We define hypothesis testing and show how to apply it to random data. Finally, we show how to apply linear regression estimates to data and estimate the degree of fit including correlation coefficients and variances.In all cases, basic ideas and equations are presented along with sample problems that illustrate the major ideas and provide practice on expected exam questions. Time: Approximately 3 hours | Difficulty Level: Medium\n\nStatics\n-This module reviews the principles of statics: Forces and moments on rigid bodies that are in equilibrium. We first discuss Newton\u2019s laws and basic concepts of what is a force, vectors, and the dimensions and units involved. Then we consider systems of forces and how to compute their resultants. We discuss the main characteristics of vectors and how to manipulate them. Then the meaning and computation of moments and couples. We discuss the concept of equilibrium of a rigid body and the categories of equilibrium in two dimensions. We show how to draw a meaningful free body diagram with different types of supports. Then how to analyze pulleys and compute static friction forces and solve problems involving friction. The concept and major characteristics of trusses are discussed, especially simple trusses, and we show how to analyze them by the method of joints and the method of sections. Finally, we analyze the geometrical properties of lines, areas, and volumes that are important in statics and mechanics of materials. These are moments of inertia, centroids, and polar moments of inertia of simple and composite objects. In all cases, basic ideas and equations are presented along with sample problems that illustrate the major ideas and provide practice on expected exam questions.Time: Approximately 3 hours | Difficulty Level: Medium\n\nMechanics of Materials\n-This module reviews the principles of the mechanics of deformable bodies. We first review the basic concepts of equilibrium and stresses and strains in prismatic bars under axial loading. Then we discuss the major mechanical properties of common engineering materials, particularly the diagrams for normal stress and strain leading to Hooke\u2019s Law, and their relation to lateral strain through Poisson\u2019s ratio. Shear stresses and their relation to shear strains are then presented. We then analyze in detail deformations and stresses in axially loaded members. This includes uniform and nonuniform loading for statically determinate and indeterminate structures. Thermal effects are then considered: expansion and contraction under temperature changes and the stresses that may develop both with and without prestresses. Stresses on inclined planes under axial loadings and the resulting maximum and minimum normal and shear stresses that result are then discussed. Torsion, the twisting of circular rods and shafts by applied torques is then analyzed. We show how to calculate the angle of twist and shear stress as functions of rod properties and shape under uniform and nonuniform torsion. Applications to power transmission by rotating shafts are presented. We then discuss how shear forces and bending moments arise in beams subject to various loading types and how to calculate them. This is then generalized to local forms of the equilibrium equations leading to rules for drawing shear force and bending moment diagrams. Finally, we compute bending stresses in beams. Strains due to bending and their relation to curvature are first discussed. This is used to compute the bending stresses and their relation to the applied bending moment and beam material and cross sectional properties. This includes a review of computation of centroids and moments of inertia of various areal shapes.

        "overview": "Everyone involved in higher education has questions. Students want to know how they\u2019re doing and which classes they should take. Faculty members want to understand their students\u2019 backgrounds and to learn whether their teaching techniques are effective. Staff members want to be sure the advice they provide is appropriate and find out whether college requirements accomplish their goals. Administrators want to explore how all of their students and faculty are doing and to anticipate emerging changes. The public wants to know what happens in college and why.\nEveryone has questions. We have the chance to help them find answers.\nPractical Learning Analytics has a specific goal: to help us collectively ponder learning analytics in a concrete way. To keep it practical, we will focus on using traditional student record data, the kinds of data every campus already has. To make it interesting, we will address questions raised by an array of different stakeholders, including campus leaders, faculty, staff, and especially students. To provide analytic teeth, each analysis we discuss will be supported by both realistic data and sample code.",
