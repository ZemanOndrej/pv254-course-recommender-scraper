		"overview": "Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems. Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI.\n\nThis course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.",

		"syllabus": "Introduction\n-Welcome to Machine Learning! In this module, we introduce the core idea of teaching a computer to learn concepts using data\u2014without being explicitly programmed. The Course Wiki is under construction. Please visit the resources tab for the most complete and up-to-date information.\n\nLinear Regression with One Variable\n-Linear regression predicts a real-valued output based on an input value. We discuss the application of linear regression to housing price prediction, present the notion of a cost function, and introduce the gradient descent method for learning.\n\nLinear Algebra Review\n-This optional module provides a refresher on linear algebra concepts. Basic understanding of linear algebra is necessary for the rest of the course, especially as we begin to cover models with multiple variables.\n\nLinear Regression with Multiple Variables\n-\nWhat if your input has more than one value? In this module, we show how linear regression can be extended to accommodate multiple input features. We also discuss best practices for implementing linear regression.\n\nOctave/Matlab Tutorial\n-This course includes programming assignments designed to help you understand how to implement the learning algorithms in practice. To complete the programming assignments, you will need to use Octave or MATLAB. This module introduces Octave/Matlab and shows you how to submit an assignment.\n\nLogistic Regression\n-Logistic regression is a method for classifying data into discrete outcomes. For example, we might use logistic regression to classify an email as spam or not spam. In this module, we introduce the notion of classification, the cost function for logistic regression, and the application of logistic regression to multi-class classification.\n\n\nRegularization\n-Machine learning models need to generalize well to new examples that the model has not seen in practice. In this module, we introduce regularization, which helps prevent models from overfitting the training data.\n\nNeural Networks: Representation\n-Neural networks is a model inspired by how the brain works. It is widely used today in many applications: when your phone interprets and understand your voice commands, it is likely that a neural network is helping to understand your speech; when you cash a check, the machines that automatically read the digits also use neural networks.\n\nNeural Networks: Learning\n-In this module, we introduce the backpropagation algorithm that is used to help learn parameters for a neural network. At the end of this module, you will be implementing your own neural network for digit recognition.\n\n\nAdvice for Applying Machine Learning\n-Applying machine learning in practice is not always straightforward. In this module, we share best practices for applying machine learning in practice, and discuss the best ways to evaluate performance of the learned models.\n\n\nMachine Learning System Design\n-To optimize a machine learning algorithm, you\u2019ll need to first understand where the biggest improvements can be made. In this module, we discuss how to understand the performance of a machine learning system with multiple parts, and also how to deal with skewed data.\n\n\nSupport Vector Machines\n-Support vector machines, or SVMs, is a machine learning algorithm for classification. We introduce the idea and intuitions behind SVMs and discuss how to use it in practice.\n\n\nUnsupervised Learning\n-We use unsupervised learning to build models that help us understand our data better. We discuss the k-Means algorithm for clustering that enable us to learn groupings of unlabeled data points.\n\nDimensionality Reduction\n-In this module, we introduce Principal Components Analysis, and show how it can be used for data compression to speed up learning algorithms as well as for visualizations of complex datasets.\n\n\nAnomaly Detection\n-Given a large number of data points, we may sometimes want to figure out which ones vary significantly from the average. For example, in manufacturing, we may want to detect defects or anomalies. We show how a dataset can be modeled using a Gaussian distribution, and how the model can be used for anomaly detection.\n\n\nRecommender Systems\n-When you buy a product online, most websites automatically recommend other products that you may like. Recommender systems look at patterns of activities between different users and different products to produce these recommendations. In this module, we introduce recommender algorithms such as the collaborative filtering algorithm and low-rank matrix factorization.\n\nLarge Scale Machine Learning\n-Machine learning works best when there is an abundance of data to leverage for training. In this module, we discuss how to apply the machine learning algorithms with large datasets.\n\nApplication Example: Photo OCR\n-Identifying and recognizing objects, words, and digits in an image is a challenging task. We discuss how a pipeline can be built to tackle this problem and how to analyze and improve the performance of such a system.",

				"text": "Machine Learning is one of the first programming MOOCs Coursera put online by Coursera founder and Stanford Professor Andrew Ng. Although Machine learning has run several times since its first offering and it doesn\u2019t seem to have been changed or updated much since then, it holds up quite well. This course assumes that you have basic programming skills. Assignments also require many vector and matrix operations and slides include some long formulas expressed in summation notation so it is recommended to have some familiarity with linear algebra. You don't need to know calculus or statistics to take this course, but you may gain deeper insight into some of the material if you do. The course uses the Octave programming language, a free clone of MATLAB.\n\nThe course runs 10 weeks and covers a variety of topics and algorithms in machine learning including gradient descent, linear and logistic regression, neural networks, support vector machines, clustering, anomaly detection, recommender systems and general advice for applying machine learning techniques. Lectures are split into 3 to 15 minute segments with periodic quizzes and each topic section has a corresponding quiz. Section quizzes are worth 1/3 of the total grade but you get unlimited attempts (with a 10-minute retry timer.). Andrew Ng does a good job explaining dense material and slides although the audio levels are often too low. If you don' have good speakers you might need headphones to hear him talk. The other 2/3 of the course grade is based on 8 multi-part programming assignments that typically involve filling in code for key functions to implement machine learning algorithms covered in lecture. The course gives you a lot of structure and direction for each homework, so it is generally pretty clear what you are supposed to do and how you are supposed to do it even if you don't understand 100% of the materiel covered in lecture. You need to achieve a total score of 80% to earn a certificate, so while you can retry quizzes and resubmit programming assignments you'll have to get most things to work in the end to get one.\n\nMachine learning is a great course if you can get past quiet audio. If you've never used Octave or MATLAB before, don't let that stop you from taking this course: learning the basics necessary to do the assignments only takes a couple of hours and it will help you think of things in terms of vectorized operations.\n\nI give this course 4.5 out of 5 stars: Great."

A.Ng is able to expose what many people would make complex in a clear and simple fashion.\n\nMany of the things I already know became much clearer after I took the course and I learned a lot of new stuff.\n\nI wish I had had such a great teacher when I was a student. I highly recommend this course for anyone getting started with machine learining.\n\nThe only problem I see with this course if that it sets the expectation bar very high for other courses. Unfortunately many other courses on Coursera, even from renowed universities, aren't as great."

It is definitely the best university level course I have ever taken, and I have taken quite a few, both in person and online (MOOC). If you have any interest whatsoever in how computers learn to recognize faces, text, or recommend movies you might like, this class is nearly perfect in every way.\n\nThe instructor is an amazing human being and as cofounder of Coursera cares deeply about education. Yes, you will have to do some programming, but the instructor assumes no previous knowledge and all the information you need is available online. You will probably need to plan to spend more time on this class than estimated if you are a newcomer to computing, but only due to your background, not because the instructor has not organized the material in the most efficient and convenient format possible. Unlike some other poorly-thought-out MOOC where you waste time looking for information or confused about what is expected, this class is extremely well organized and presented in a straightforward, humble manner. In fact, I would suggest that any professor wishing to teach an online MOOC class should take this class first to see how real teaching is done by a professional who really knows the material but is not trying to impress the students with his knowledge by confusing them unnecessarily.\n\nThis is not an easy class, but it is tremendously rewarding to complete. It will probably expand your mind a few IQ points."

I was initially turned off by the use of MATLAB/Octave as the programming language of choice for the assignments, but I found them relatively painless and well-crafted to give the student a modular view of how these machine learning algorithms work and the possible optimizations when implementing them.\n\nI had exposure to many of the concepts before taking the class, but had never implemented or understood the mathematics behind any of the algorithms until taking this MOOC. It serves equally well as an overview of some of the most important \"bread and butter\" techniques in the field as it does a jumping off point into other, more specialized machine learning lessons. In fact, that is my suggestion for anyone interested in this MOOC: take it and complete all the lessons, then immediately dive into using the techniques in another MOOC or toward a project of your choosing to maximize the benefits.\n\nThe concepts covered in this MOOC include linear regression, logistic regression, forward propagation and backpropagation in neural networks, support vector machines, recommendation systems, and collaborative filtering."

This class does none of that. Really, it DOES NOT! I have maybe spent 150 hours on this class hoping to get something real out of it. All I got is confusion and a better idea about the topic in general. After 150 hours you should be able to confortably produce something, no? Well, I was not able to do more than the taxi driver next door. What a time sucking class for zero workable knowledge!!!! Then I went to take the same class on Datacamp. Believe or not, one month later I was doing GREAT stuff with it (I am pro trader) and the total time spent on it was about 20% what I had spend on coursera. Frankly, this class is plain BS given the ratio of what you get versus what time it takes... Never again!"

There's a reason for this: the focus of the course is on algorithms, not on other parts of solving machine learning problems\n\nMy final concern is that Machine Learning seems to have gone on autopilot at this point, with little or no attention from Ng or anyone else who helped him prepare the course materials. Questions in the discussion forum are answered instead by \"Community TA's\", that is, volunteers who took earlier sessions of the course.\n\nDespite these concerns, I still heartily recommend Machine Learning as a valuable starting point for anyone interested in data science."

First of all, the set-up instructions for Mac were broken. Much more importantly, the class is not comparable to Andrew\u2019s actual ML class at Stanford. Throughout the course, he keeps telling students not to worry about the math, and spoon feeding equations to us. Worse still, I was able to get a 150% (i.e. massive extra credit) on the first assignment without actually understanding what was going on. The programming assignments were mostly done for us, with just a line or two that needed to be filled in. Amazingly, those missing lines were sometimes in the class slides.

For someone like me, new to Matlab/Octave, these significantly increase the time requirement for the coding assignments - which are clearly intended to be pretty simple if you know what you're supposed to be doing. This adds to the already high frustration level learning a new programming language/environment can entail.

Together, they are designed to help people with no prior exposure to computer science or programming learn to think computationally and write programs to tackle useful problems. Some of the people taking the two courses will use them as a stepping stone to more advanced computer science courses, but for many it will be their first and last computer science courses. This run features lecture videos, lecture exercises, and problem sets using Python 3.5. Even if you previously took the course with Python 2.7, you will be able to easily transition to Python 3.5 in future courses, or enroll now to refresh your learning.\nSince these courses may be the only formal computer science courses many of the students take, we have chosen to focus on breadth rather than depth. The goal is to provide students with a brief introduction to many topics so they will have an idea of what is possible when they need to think about how to use computation to accomplish some goal later in their career. That said, they are not \"computation appreciation\" courses. They are challenging and rigorous courses in which the students spend a lot of time and effort learning to bend the computer to their will.",

Some examples: we had to write programs that could monitor news feeds over the internet, simulate the behavior of a Roomba vacuum, model the growth of viruses in a sick patient, and determine the best path between nodes on a graph. You always have two weeks to complete a problem set, which is enough to give you some flexibility yet still allows you to stay on a steady schedule.\n\nThere were some logistical difficulties with the course: the last problem set wasn't released on schedule, and so the concepts I learned towards the very end of the class felt a little rushed and untested.

The lectures aren't presented very clearly. The slides are disorganized, often times with the professor making random, nonsensical scribbles that are more distracting than helpful. When you do see the code example screen, there's old code, unused code, and sometimes superfluous code that would be extremely confusing to a beginner. Topics in the first few weeks don't seem to build on one another in a very logical manner. The exercises seem to be very pedantic in nature. The tests that run against your solutions to the exercises require the solution to be entered in an exact format. So for example, if you enter in \"1,2,3,4\" your solution will be rejected since the tests is looking for \"1, 2, 3, 4\". There's a bit of irony in that a class on programming doesn't have a test capable of parsing out the solution you input. Maybe I'm not paying as much attention as I should, but I swear there are exercises that ask you to use concepts you wouldn't know about from just having watched the lectures. In addition to these issues, there are some community TA's that seem to be almost combative in the class discussion forums. I'm really hoping that this class improves the deeper in you get. I'd imagine that a lot of people take this class purely based on the prestige associated with the MIT name but if you're new to coding you'd do yourself a favor by either taking Harvard's CS50 or grabbing the topics in the course and finding one of the hundreds of bootcamp blog posts that cover these same topics."

On-screen the graphics are difficult to follow with a very small font making it hard to see key characters.

From a speck of humble dust in the giant bureaucratic machine, to a first-year Bachelor student of Computer Science at a recognizable university at the age of 26!\n\nMy life trajectory is running on a new track, and in the determination of this amazing transition (it is especially hard if you are from the developing world where the society is not so tolerant), I'd say this MOOC plays a fundamental role.\n\nThanks to edx, thanks to MITx!"

				"text": "This course has been my best online 'tutorial'. Instructor approaches teaching from 'first principle' and for me that is the way to go. I was able to grasp the fundamentals of programming on the fly. I entered the course with the aim of getting first hand education on python programming to enable me write scripts for digital design as an architect but I chanced upon a requisite knowledge I never earlier imagined. Each lesson was modest in design, well defined in specific objective, and understandable information. It covered a wide range of lessons needed for computer programming and would recommend it for anybody who wants to learn computer science."

The class is somewhat medium-to-hard to follow and requires quite an attention and regularity of attendance (it's an esteemed MIT after all) but presenters and authors MIT's Professors John V. Guttag, Eric Grimson and Ana Bell did an extraordinary job of making a learning curve as gentle and pleasant as humanly possible. Personally, to me it's the very Eric Grimson's teaching style which kept me going."

As a non-cs major heading into a master's CS program, the exposure to this class gave me tremendous confidence in moving into the next level. the psets, coupled with exercises between lectures fortified my understanding of the materials seamlessly. I highly recommend this class to anyone interested in learning python, and programming in general."

That said, I learned a lot and found it to be of higher quality than several undergraduate courses I took as an enrolled student at a respected university. I am not a programming type and my brain does not naturally take to this kind of material. If you have a thick skin and are interested in the topic, this is the course you want. Many of the concepts helped me substantially in understanding how to use other programs like R effectively."

Even for someone who has programmed for a year or so, this course can be tough. So, if you are merely starting, don't feel belittled. This is a magnificent course, and even if you just complete it, without scoring good, trust me, you will take many things out of it for future. Will normally take around 12-15 hours a week, but if you are new might take long."

The way it approaches CS is the best I've seen so far, giving real examples of usage of all the concepts, it's really motivating.\n\nRegarding difficulty, it has the perfect balance: the challenges are demanding but not so hard that you feel frustrated or can't complete it.\n\nI totally recommend this one, but I advise you that if your only goal is to learn Python, maybe it is not the best choice, as you will use a lot of time on others subjects rather then just programming."

The other important characteristic is very active discussion forum, where it is possible to find support or get answers for a variety of questions. And, third, despite frequent claims to the contrary, automatic grader gets the job done - with a proper implementation throughout all the course I haven't managed to get any errors or incorrect behaviour from it."
